"sum : computer transcription a couple of months ago , i asked the members of this list for help regarding software for the transcription of spoken discourse . i received a large number of answers , some to my personal e-mail address , some ' public ' . in the following i shall quote some of the answers and attempt to sum up what i consider to be the most important info received on the matter : perhaps slightly off the subject a few answers spoke of the possibilities for machine-readable text : quote : ' a company named norris communication ( san diego , ca ) sells a digital recorder that breaks down audio input into machine readable code ( including ascii i assume ) ' ' norris is reputed to be only one of two companies in the usa ( maybe the world ) manufacturing digital audio recorders using so-called "" flash chips "" ( semiconductor memory chips that permit both read and write functions ) . the digitized flash memory can be "" dumped "" to a pc in machine readable code ( which i assume would include ascii compatibility - - that 's my assumption ) . i do n't have an address , but i got their telephone number from directory assistance . the company is located in a suburb of san diego , california called poway , california . the listed telephone number is 619-679 - 1504 . if that does n't work for some reason , directory assistance can be reached at 619-555 - 1212 . ' a number of answers centered around using standard word processors ' macro facilities : quote : ' i used to do this quite satisfactorily on the pc using ms word with glossary items to quickly input speaker identification , special character sequences , etc . use a style sheet for controlling formatting . i imagine that word perfect for the pc can do the same thing , especially with its macros . ' ' i ' ve made a set of macro 's which operate on a standardized form to facilitate the transcribing process . essentially what i did is simply reduce all routinely occurring series of keystrokes to one alt - or control - key . ' most transcription software seems to be available for the mac : quote : ' for the macintosh i would definitely use nisus with a macro that has been assigned a short and easy to type keyboard shortcut . from little things like this to far more complex tasks , nisus is amazing . it is truly the power user 's and linguist 's word processor of choice . from what i have seen , it is also the most worldscript - savvy word processor available . if you have n't seen it , check out the new nisuswriter 4 . 0 which should be shipping very soon if not already . ' more info may be available from this internet address : nisus . mktg @ applelink . apple . com syncwriter : quote : ' the mac - programme you mention is syncwriter , i guess . it costs some hundred german marks ' syncwriter is sold by : med - i-bit , hohenfelderstrasse 20 , 22087 hamburg , germany ( phone + 49 40 251 67 125 ) . workbench : quote : ' you are welcome to include the workbench in your summary . however , as you know the bench is not really a transcription program , though it has some features for making transcribing easier - - e . g . the transcription keypad ( with user definable strings and ca symbols ) and the ability to link and play in a loop quicktime movie audio tapes . also , do mention that distribution is limited at this time . the bench is now available on the world wide web . ' for further info , try contacting : thebench @ alishaw . ucsb . edu for dos - based computers : hiat-dos 2 . 2 : quote : ' hiat-dos was developed as a transcription programme everybody can afford ; that is why it lacks certain technical gimmicks . the price of the new version is somewhat between 40 and 80 german marks ( as far as i know ) ; it is distributed by ' : prof . konrad ehlich institut fuer deutsch als fremdsprache lmu muenchen ludwigstrasse 27 d-80359 muenchen fax : germany-089 / 21802116 . quote : ' hiat-dos is a kind of word processing program designed for processing transcripts ; thus you ' ve got a certain format in which you fill the transcript , you ' ve got certain special correction devices etc . it 's a simple tool which is more comfortable for transcription purposes than word processing programs , that 's all . ' recommended reading : ehlich , konrad ( 1992 ) hiat - a transcription system for discourse data . in : edwards , jane a . / lampert , martin d . ( eds . ) talking data . hillsdale n . j . : erlbaum . a couple of other programs ( mac and dos ) were mentioned , but they seem to be unfinished so far . why is it that noone has developed a user-friendly windows - based transcription program ? the above mentioned transcription programs all use the text / music score principle , i . e . , the conversation is printed in ' running ' systems . if you , as i do myself , use standard line transcription , there seems to be very little help out there to save you from adjusting a lot whenever you make any changes or corrections to your transript . one possibility may be a system of macros - perhaps this calls for further discussion in this forum ? ? ? thank you to everyone for your cooperation , karsten gramkow karsten gramkow centre for languages and intercultural studies aalborg university havrevangen 1 dk - 9000 aalborg denmark ph . : + 45 98 15 42 11 , ext . 6229 fax : + 45 98 16 65 66 e-mail : gramkow @ hum . auc . dk",Safe Email

SpamAssassin here so that our users understand it.I define ""Solicited Commercial Email"" vs ""Unsolicited Commercial Email"" -
the latter being SPAM. As SpamAssassin basically looks for ""Commercial

"linguistics association of great britain linguistics association of great britain the 1995 autumn meeting will be held from monday 18 september to wednesday 20 september at the university of essex , where the association will be the guests of the department of language and linguistics . enquiries and bookings ( by 25 august ) should be sent to : lagb 1995 , david britain and stella markantonatou , department of language and linguistics , university of essex , colchester , essex , great britain co4 3sq . events : the henry sweet lecture 1995 on the monday evening will be delivered by professor edwin williams ( princeton ) , and is entitled "" focus and anaphoric destressing "" . there will also be a special guest lecture by professor greg stump ( kentucky ) , entitled "" the autonomy of morphomic indexing "" . professor williams will also be participating in a workshop on the topic of ellipsis , focus and anaphora , on the monday afternoon . the workshop is organised by david adger ( york ) ; other contributors are caroline heycock ( edinburgh ) , ruth kempson , ( soas ) and wynn chao ( soas ) . there will be a language tutorial on the australian language kayardild ( note change of language ) , given by dr nicholas evans ( melbourne ) . kayardild is a tangkic language of bentinck island , north west queensland , and the two sessions will aim to cover the main features of the grammar , exemplified as far as possible through study of a traditional text . after situating the language sociolinguistically , most of the tutorial will deal with morphosyntactic features of typological interest , in particular with its complex and unusual nominal morphology : the use of ' modal case ' to signal mood and tense categories on nps within the vp ; a further use of ' complementizing case ' , marked on every word of a clause , to show interclausal relations , and the phenomenon of case stacking that leads to nouns inflecting for up to four cases , forcing morphological representations to have ( finitely ) recursive case features . a final feature of nominal case morphology is the presence of a subset of case suffixes , known to tangkicists as ' verbal case ' , which , though demonstrably an inflectional category , converts the morphological class of its host from nominal to verb , thus posing problems to the view that inflections never change word class . internet home page : the lagb internet home page is now active at the following address : http : / / clwww . essex . ac . uk / lagb . electronic network : please join the lagb electronic network which is used for disseminating lagb information and for consulting members quickly . it can be subscribed to by sending the message "" add lagb "" to : listserv @ postman . essex . ac . uk . programme : monday 18 september 1995 2 . 00 workshop : "" ellipsis , focus and anaphora "" organised by david adger ( york ) ; participants : edwin williams ( princeton ) , caroline heycock ( edinburgh ) , ruth kempson , ( soas ) , wynn chao ( soas ) . 7 . 45 henry sweet lecture 1995 : edwin williams ( princeton ) tuesday 19 september 1995 session a 9 . 00 j . m . de wind ( amsterdam ) "" inverted subjects in french , nominative case -

Hash: SHA1Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).        green   This is probably not spam.spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.- --Michael

Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ETMISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

"re : hpl sale - energy operations task list sally , thanks for our meeting last week . please let me know if you don ' t think we ' ve sufficiently defined the deliverable for business ops . based on feedback from louise - you and i still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required . specifically , aep and enron need to agree in writing for each business ops "" process "" or function : 1 . who is going to carry out the business ops processes before and after close . 2 . how control over the process will be handed over from enron to aep . 3 . the necessary it actions required to put the required system functionality in place ( and who is responsible for implementing this ) . the table you developed at the end of last week ( based on bob ' s email ) moves closer to this point . as we discussed on the phone , we need to provide a description of the deliverables for each of the "" systems / activities "" you listed on the table and ensure that aep understands ( and signs off on ) what they are responsible for . to anne ' s point , this "" sign off "" can be through a memo , protocol , acknowledged email , or other . we have been having a problem in that one part of aep does not talk to the other part . so , i would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual bob hall / steve jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of aep ( and enron ) understand what is being agreed before we close . each tuesday at 4 : 00 we have a standing hpl transition coordination meeting to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group . you are welcome to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each wednesday with bob h . and tommy y . to concentrate on hpl / it / business ops matters . sally , thanks for you personal attention to this . the quicker we close the quicker bob can focus more of his time on network ' s origination efforts . regards , brian enron north america corp . from : sally beck 03 / 30 / 2001 03 : 34 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : bob m hall / na / enron @ enron , leslie reeves / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect subject : hpl sale - energy operations task list i talked with anne koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl . anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "" protocol "" into these discussions . to clarify , according to anne , the "" protocol "" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document . instead , anne envisions simply e : mails or memos between enron and aep with regard to any sharing of information , agreements on processes to be followed in the transition , etc . operational details to be decided between enron and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date , with e : mails being sent from bob ball ( enron ) to steve jackson ( aep ) . only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented . bob hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may . he has worked with enron ' s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with sandi braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement . as of today , legal has completed revisions to that amendment and anne koehler is sending it to mary perkins in enron ' s treasury group for her review . upon mary ' s review , anne will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures . we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aep - hpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you . this new format incorporates the various memos and e : mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues . items that only require actions by enron will be our "" to do "" list . each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress . those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the enron and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep and / or their agreement via the e : mails or memos as suggested by ann koehler . i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "" protocol "" . we will also update you weekly on the status of those e : mails and / or memos between ourselves and aep . i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale . to provide clarity for these update meetings , may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches : 1 ) brian and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status , or 2 ) i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you . please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week .",Safe Email

I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China
motherboards, but I've seen same behavior once. Changing the battery helps
that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).Just my 2 cents.MishaOn Wed, 28 Aug 2002, Aherne Peter-pahern02 wrote:> Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.

Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=carotid+arteries&spell=1

remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 people you mailed . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or 1 / 2 , or even one 1 / 5 of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 500 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people may do just that , and more ! method # 2 : placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet can easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the emails they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . order each report by its number & name only . note : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks or money orders are not accepted . make sure the cash is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number and the name of the report you are ordering , your email address , your name and postal address . make sure you affix proper ' international ' postage if ordering a report from outside your country . place your order for these reports now : report 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net . . . order from : p . hynes 6461 mayfield rd brampton , on canada l 6 t 3 z 8 report 2 : the insiders guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net . . . order from : lynn asbill 9400 bluebonnet dr scurry , tx 75158 usa report 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net . . . order from : greg grant po box 385 wilberforce , on canada kol 3 co report 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net . . . order from : lw 50 burnhamthorpe rd w suite 401 mississauga , on canada l 5 b 3 c 2 report 5 : how to send out one million emails & jump start your business . . . order from : bdm consulting po box 890 orem , ut 84059 usa there are currently almost 500 , 000 , 000 people online worldwide !

"" you also want to indicate , "" the fact that i understand what you have said does not necessarily mean i agree with you . "" clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is a critical vital sign . the fear of loving relatives that something bad can happen has to be balanced against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their self - esteem , you are attacking a most vulnerable part of their anatomy . you cannot negotiate away a person ' s self - esteem , but you can destroy it through frontal and flanking attacks . the frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal . very often the people who have advocated professional care ultimately must mutter ( hopefully to themselves ) the unsatisfying statement , "" i told you so . "" in your question you indicate that crisis forces choice . perhaps the best approach is to prepare a safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs . it cannot prevent a crisis from happening ; and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the ' victim ' of it to lose face . but having that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of the fall . relationship is one of the seven most significant issues to consider in negotiation . focusing on the relationship with an elderly parent or friend , not letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring can make it much easier when someone ' s self - esteem is attacked by a crisis . looking at oneself and saying , "" it ' s not my fault , "" is not a way of avoiding blame , but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakes - - just as they did the first time they gave us the keys to the car . tnsc news the negotiation skills company ' s website , www . negotiationskills . com , is now getting more than 1 . 5 million ' hits ' a year - that means an average of more than 5000 visits every day . there have been newspaper and magazine articles about us across north america - and we ' re now featured in translation in a web magazine in poland . last word "" don ' t look back . somebody may be gaining on you .

"Every once in a while, I get notifications in my root mailbox that my
personal mail is being rejected.  The message is 'No Catalogue Servers
available at this time.'  Since I use razor V1 through Mail::Audit
(using is_spam), I tried several ways to try to trap this error and
allow my mail to be delivered on these occassions but nothing seemed
to work.I started digging through the code and found several uses of exit
inside the razor code.  This is a very anti-social thing for a module
to do.  It takes away my option to bypass the spam check and deliver
the mail anyway.  The razor modules should signal errors through die
or warn.  razor-check could catch these and, knowing it's being called
during mail delivery, issue an appropriate message and exit status for
the MTA.  The razor modules don't know who's calling them and
shouldn't make this decision.  I'm wondering how much legitimate mail
I'm missing because of this.I certainly hope this is being addressed in the new version.--

Date: Not suppliedThe DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:""     Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable ï¿½ such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit ï¿½ may now be possible.     With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)[1] http://www.fossil.energy.gov/techline/tl_intellipipe.shtml

"Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train 
Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious."" To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

"" a combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas - fired power generation facilities in california is fueling expansion of the system , "" said kirk morgan , director of business development for kern river and northwest pipeline . the project includes construction of three new compressor stations , an additional compressor at an existing facility in wyoming , restaging a compressor in utah , and upgrading two meter stations . kern river said the $ 80 million project is targeted to be complete by may 1 , 2002 . the company said demand for firm transportation on kern river was driven by several factors : the diversion of canadian gas supplies to markets in the midwest from the pacific region ; increased production in the rocky mountain basin ; strong economic growth in kern river ' s market areas ; and increased demand from gas - fired electric generation facilities . williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the kern river pipeline .

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit . "" shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , "" he said . "" to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . "" enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls from the associated press on wednesday . while enron ' s stock price has made it attractive , coale said the energy marketer ' s problems present a substantial drawback . "" i would fault a company for acquiring enron with all of this hanging over it , "" she said . "" there are too many uncertainties . "" grubert said he believes enron has the ability "" to weather the storm and restore their enterprise on their own . "" since reporting its disappointing third quarter losses , enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines . the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : few signs of domino effect among enron ' s peers . by andrew kelly 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp ' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered . "" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , "" said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . "" i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , "" he said . enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks . and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said . "" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , "" said prudential securities analyst carole coale . uncomfortable with disclosure coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits . el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants . analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron . el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings . dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio . asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any "" related party transactions "" . former high - fliers shunned analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines . in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks . on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an "" asset - light "" philosophy . williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market . j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface . "" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , "" he said . credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was .

' ' the company hasn ' t said how much it expects to make from trading . analysts aren ' t expecting the business to contribute significantly to waste management ' s earnings . ` ` they are looking at it as a good time to get in on trading but i don ' t see it as a major contributor to their business , ' ' said stewart scharf , an analyst with standard & poor ' s equity group . he rates waste management ` ` accumulate ' ' and doesn ' t own shares . republic services group inc . , the no . 3 u . s . waste company , contracts with individual mills to supply recycled commodities at fixed prices , but hasn ' t started a trading operation , spokesman will flower said . allied waste industries inc . , the second - largest trash hauler in north america , said it has no plans to get into trading . ` ` we ' ll leave trading to people like enron , ' ' allied waste spokesman michael burnett said . - - mark johnson in the princeton newsroom ( 609 ) 750 - 4662 enron ends 10 - day skid with 25 % jump lisa sanders cbsmarketwatch . com october 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked wednesday after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron added 25 percent , or $ 2 . 74 , to close at $ 13 . 90 . more than 43 million shares changed hands , making the stock the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . a . g . edwards ' analyst michael heim warned wednesday against buying enron shares . he noted that enron ' s troubles could be hurting its trading operations , the company ' s strength .

' s press release about its third - quarter results included this statement , attributed to louis gerstner , chairman and chief executive officer : ` ` ibm ' s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the technology industry , or any industry . ' ' the largest maker of computers and provider of computer services wasn ' t the only company to cite its balance sheet , a statistical summary of what a company owned , what it owed , and what was left over for shareholders on a specific date . general electric co . , the largest company by stock market value , and citigroup inc . , the no . 1 financial - services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape -

""" english plus "" resolution in congress the "" english - plus "" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ;

Lennon killer seeks parole againThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"n - ary vs . binary lloyd anderson asks how n-ary ( for n greater than 2 ) comparison could ever be worse than binary . consider the problem of heads and tails when we toss coins . what are the chances of two coins ( standing for two languages obviously ) both coming up the same ( i . e . , both heads or both tails ) when tossed once ? since there are four possible outcomes of the binary toss , namely , hh , ht , tt , and th , and only two where both come up the same , the chances are 50 % . but now consider what happens when we toss three coins ( standing for three languages ) . since a coin only has two sides , in each possible outcome at least two of the coins come up the same . so the chances of 2 out of 3 coming up the same ( which would correspond to saying let two out of three languages agree in something and then they are related ) are 100 % ( which means this is not a valid test for relatedness ) . of course , if we had wanted all 3 out 3 to come up the same , then the situation would be drastically different , but in linguistics n-ary comparison never to my knowledge involves such a requirement . however , the only reason that n-ary comparison does so poorly here is that ( a ) there are only two possible outcomes per language , i . e . , languages come in only two varieties , and ( b ) the number of languages being compared is small ( only three ) . the ( a ) part is the one where real linguistic applications are drastically different from our little coin-tossing game ( since when you look for language relationships , you are looking at hundreds or thousands or maybe even more possibilities , not two , because you are looking at phonological shapes of morphemes mostly , and these allow lots of possibilities , at least thousands ) . so in the real situations that alone insures that n-ary comparison is better than binary . but it is also true that if you increase the number of coins ( languages ) in ( b ) , that also has the same effect . but you still have to be careful : the main concern is that given n languages being compared you must worry about how many out of the n are required to agree and about not making that number too small ( if you do , then again chance tends to take over ) . which raises a question : is there any published work on comparing languages which explicitly calculates these numbers ( and does it right ) ? alexis mr",Safe Email

"project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ;

with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the

"re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

"errors in language learning . james , carl . ( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from "" mistakes "" , which simple "" correct / incorrect "" paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as "" an unsuccessful bit of language "" ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the "" broad trawl "" ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what "" proper "" language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a "" correct "" dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the "" complaints "" tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , "" standard "" english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not "" taking sides "" with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might "" gate "" a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for "" the irritation factor "" . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

"tone grammar none of the examples mentioned in john cowan 's recent posting summarizing responses on this topic appears to involve a language that uses language solely to mark grammatical as opposed to lexical distinctions . which makes one wonder about stress . does anybody know of an example of a language in which stress is distinctive but only used to mark grammatical categories . i have some possible examples in mind but these need some further reflection , so if anybody has clear examples , i for one would be interested ( the examples i am thinking of , which i am not too sure about , would involve tongan and perhaps persian ) .",Safe Email

"Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm
Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

""" linguist / - ician "" : a new slant . i have been quite happy so far to sit back and let the discourse about the relative merits of the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistician "" unfold unhampered by any intervention from me . i am , first and foremost , a lover of language ( s ) ; a person who studies language ( s ) , their history and their "" idiosyncrasies "" . i call myself a "" linguist "" . i might add that i do not myself fully understand the theories propounded by those who call themselves "" linguist [ ician ] s "" ( in the sense of someone engaged in "" linguistics "" , that is ) , nor do i really care what precisely they choose to call themselves ( or their area of study ) . do "" physicists "" and "" physicians "" have the same argument , i wonder ? ! i doubt it . quite coincidentally of this discourse , enid wai - ching mok ( < enid @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > ) circulated recently a questionnaire for information on the terms "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" in various languages . i happened upon an entry in her summary supposedly explaining the two russian terms "" jazykoved "" ( linguist ) and "" jazykoznanie "" ( linguistics ) . these were offered by a certain woody mott also of < uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu > : they were so infelicitous in their detail and ill construed in their interpretation that i was impelled to reply to this entry and ( as a "" linguist "" ) correct certain misconceptions . allow me to summarise : notwithstanding the argument whether these words are current or not in russian , i think an explanation of their etymology may be of some use to the general discourse on the merits of "" linguist "" vs . "" linguistician "" . the word "" jazykoved "" is composed of 2 roots : "" jazyk "" , meaning "" tongue "" or "" language "" and "" ved "" , meaning "" knowledgeable person "" ( cognates for "" ved "" ( < old russian "" vedeti "" ( e = the vowel ' jat ' ) ) "" knowing person "" , pace woody mott , are sanskrit "" ve : da "" , gothic "" wait "" , and english "" wit "" ) . the "" - o - "" is here merely a link vowl . a suitable english calque on the russian term , therefore , would be "" tongue-wit "" . this , in turn , reminded me of an article some years ago in which "" saxonist "" terms were advanced in favour of "" latinate "" heresies in the english - speaking world . thus , we have foreword for "" preface "" ( the argument here goes back to 1842 ) ; bodeful for "" ominous "" ; birdlore for "" ornithology "" , etc . , etc . i ' m sure we are bounded only by time and our imaginations as to other suggestions . mindful of the fact that there are probably many among you who are staunch adherents of the "" latinate "" tradition , and not wishing in any way to alienate or belittle that corpus of english vocabulary , i should , nevertherless , like to propose two alternatives to "" linguist "" and "" linguistics "" based on the "" saxonist "" principles above . tongue-wit ( noun ) "" a person versed / skilled in [ the study of ] language ( s ) "" tongue-lore ( noun ) "" the study of language ( s ) "" i leave it to the individual "" linguist [ ician ] "" to choose whether these terms are suited to their own area of study . i think that the "" saxonist "" terms do have the advantage at least of smacking of down - to-earth prurience and a lack of self-importance . a similar term "" tonguester "" , suggested earlier , is an admirable alternative . i for one am quite happy to call myself a "" tongue-wit "" engaged in "" tongue - lore "" - - others , i hope , will follow and leave the "" linguist [ ician ] s "" to sort themselves out . tony hall . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * tony hall * * * department of russian language * * * university of birmingham * * * edgbaston tel : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 3227 * * * birmingham b15 2tt fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 5966 * * * united kingdom email : a . r . hall @ bham . ac . uk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Safe Email

  beberg@mithral.com--------EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press WriterWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved.""The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure.""The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.",Safe Email

"profit on technology ! ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , "" trillion dollar emerging market "" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of "" bundled services "" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this "" bundled services "" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are "" bundled services "" such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , "" bundled services "" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a "" free package of services "" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that "" word of mouth "" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is "" income replacement "" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it "" internetworking "" . the reason we call it "" internetworking "" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing",Phishing Email

"new book : language processes social and cognitive approaches to interpersonal communication edited by susan r . fussell , carnegie mellon university roger j . kreuz , university of memphis historically , the social aspects of language use have been considered the domain of social psychology , while the underlying psycholinguistic mechanisms have been the purview of cognitive psychology . recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that these two dimensions are highly interrelated : cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact with social psychological factors , such as beliefs about one 's interlocutors and politeness norms , and with the dynamics of the conversation itself , to produce shared meaning . this realization has led to an exciting body of research integrating the social and cognitive dimensions which has greatly increased our understanding of human language use . this volume contains a collection of papers by noted social and cognitive psychologists illustrating this theme . each chapter demonstrates how the theoretical approaches and research methods of social and cognitive psychology can be successfully interwoven to provide insight into one or more fundamental questions about the process of interpersonal communication . the topics under investigation include the nature and role of speaker intentions in the communicative process , the production and comprehension of indirect speech and figurative language , perspective-taking and conversational collaboration , and the relationships between language , cognition , culture , and social interaction . the book will be of interest to all those who study interpersonal language use : social and cognitive psychologists , theoretical and applied linguists , and communication researchers . 0-8058 - 2269 - 0 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 59 . 95 0-8058 - 2270 - 4 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 32 . 50 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com",Safe Email

the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the

Meanwhile, the administration says that it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

Apple to expand iMac LCD displayApple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources.
The upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000 accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman.

			  Volume 6, Number 2
			      June, 2002In this issue:* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
* European Union bans spamIF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
""About This Message"" section at the end.- --------------------------------------------------------------* Progress of Senate anti-spam billOver a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630: http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtmlWe're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.- --------------------------------------------------------------* European Union bans spamGLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTEMay 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site ,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
. More information on
the international CAUCE network of affiliate organizations is
available at .- --------------------------------------------------------------About This Message:This message was written and broadcast by the Coalition Against

"comparative method : n - ary comparison again some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 .",Safe Email

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this

"Dear Sir,My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco
Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,
1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view
of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give
you 25% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.Respectfully submitted,Obi   W.

grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal

help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it

"sum : native speaker intuitions several weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of "" native speaker intutions "" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach "" modern english grammar , "" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , "" john asked mary to leave , "" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like "" john asked to leave , "" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do "" generative "" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , "" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . ' john asked mary to leave , ' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) "" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as "" john asked mary to leave "" as meaning "" john asked mary 's permission to leave "" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that "" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we ' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . "" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in "" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , "" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that "" we ' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . "" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences "" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . "" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the ' permission ' reading peculiar . tony 's examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze 's forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : "" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 's were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . "" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous",Safe Email

' s credit and debt ratings have fallen to junk status , crippling what once was the largest u . s . energy trader , observers are pointing fingers , and wondering what took the top three u . s . credit rating agencies so long to act . "" the rating agencies are at fault here for waiting so long and thinking they could hold the deal together , "" said tom burnett , a director of merger insight , a research and analysis firm . "" that ' s not their job . there ' s not one new piece of information available today that wasn ' t available last week . "" the agencies - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch - denied being influenced to keep enron ' s once investment - grade ratings , or they declined to discuss the issue . observers , though , said investment banks arranging enron ' s now - dissolved merger with once - smaller rival dynegy inc . - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - had been fighting to preserve those ratings . they now stand to lose millions of dollars of advisory fees with the merger ' s collapse . "" s & p and moody ' s have stated that they ' re not going to be the cause of problems for a company , and in my opinion waited until dynegy decided not to proceed with the merger , "" said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . in philadelphia . egan - jones on wednesday cut its own debt rating for enron to "" c , "" one notch above default . anger grows prices on enron ' s distressed bonds had been in a tailspin for several sessions , and after wednesday ' s cuts they fell by more than half . traders bid them on wednesday near 25 cents on the dollar , with often triple - digit yields . "" i do get the feeling there is a lot of anger and feeling that something should have occurred before "" wednesday , said mary ann hurley , vice president of fixed - income trading at d . a . davidson in seattle . "" there was talk in the markets that the absence of official statements from dynegy and enron ( on ) tuesday should have been taken by the rating agencies as a clue that the merger was about to fall apart . "" that happened on wednesday . within about a two - hour period , the rating agencies cut their senior unsecured debt ratings for enron - to "" b - minus "" by s & p , to "" b 2 "" by moody ' s , and to "" cc "" by fitch . almost simultaneous with the fitch downgrade , dynegy announced it had backed out of the $ 9 billion merger . the three big rating agencies are paid by companies to assess their ability to repay debt . many companies need these ratings to raise money from investors . sometimes , though , the agencies face criticism for being too slow to act , or being susceptible to outside pressure . indeed , in january they were criticized for waiting for actual defaults before downgrading california utilities pacific gas & electric co . and southern california edison to junk status . role of agencies with regard to the proposed enron - dynegy merger , on nov . 8 , a day before the merger was announced , top citigroup and j . p . morgan officials met with moody ' s , a person familiar with the meeting said . a day later , moody ' s cut enron ' s rating , but not to junk . john diaz , a moody ' s managing director , denied facing new pressures this week . "" in any rating activity , we ' re discussing developments with the companies , so we ' ve been in touch with the companies as we normally would do , "" he said . "" we have not had contact with the banks . "" ron barone , an s & p director , denied getting pressure from banks this week to hold off on a rating downgrade . "" none whatsoever , "" he said in a conference call . "" no substance at all . we have not been in contact with the banks . "" meanwhile , glen grabelsky , a senior director in fitch ' s policy group , said "" our conversations with the issuers and the agents are confidential . "" diaz and grabelsky said their respective agencies did not decide until wednesday morning to downgrade enron . "" there wasn ' t one specific event to trigger the downgrade , "" said diaz . "" in the last couple of days our concerns were heightened given the rate of erosion of the ( enron ) franchise , and the declining probability the merger would be consummated as originally expected . "" grabelsky said : "" when we lost confidence in the transaction , that ' s when we started preparing to notify the markets . "" d . a . davidson ' s hurley said the delays could be understandable .

"" enron is in some ways the victim of its own success , "" said gerald keenan , lead energy strategy partner at pwc consulting , part of . "" all this wouldn ' t have occured if the market wasn ' t deregulated . "" enron was one of the earliest and most aggressive advocates of power deregulation , which breaks down traditional utility monopolies by letting customers choose their electricity provider , banking on competition to drive down prices . its aggressive strategies gave enron 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , and enron was ranked no . 7 on fortune magazine ' s list of the biggest u . s . companies . the downfall but in recent weeks , enron ' s credit and debt spiralled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused its investors to lose faith . the partnerships , which included top enron executives , are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation . in a fluid , competitive marketplace , punishment comes quickly . enron ' s share price closed at 61 cents on wednesday , down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , from a peak of over $ 90 in august 2000 , after the top three u . s . rating agenices downgraded enron to junk status . "" there are winners and losers in deregulated markets and people who champion them are not necessarily those who will be around in the end , "" keenan said . as more business and mounting profits fell into enron ' s hands , the company took on a air of invicibility . despised by some market players , many of its trading partners nevertheless were willing to go out on a limb because of enron ' s good reputation , smart traders , and high - flying share price . enron ' s core business of trading electricity and natural gas relies highly on creditworthiness , and much of its trading was backed by a corporate guarantee , a kind of standby iou . once that credit guarantee began to be be doubted , credit managers pulled the fire alarm and reduced their exposure . "" up to about two months ago , an enron corporate guarantee was seen by many as money in the bank . then the whole house of cards came down , "" keenan said . people began looking at enron more closely , especially since october when a series of negative disclosures about the company ' s finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off - balance sheet transactions . enron ' s trading business - its crown jewel - has also suffered from lower volumes as wary trading partners shifted business away from the cash - poor and credit - threatened enron . what now ? if enron ' s fallout has a significant affect on the regulated companies it did business with , regulators and policymakers could slow down the pace of power deregulation . but if the damage is confined to the wholesale trading market , there will not be as much impact , analysts said . so far , 23 states and the district of columbia have moved to deregulate their retail power markets , although nearly one third of them have delayed the onset of competition partly due to california ' s failed free market experiment . analysts also said if enron is no longer a major player in the large customer market , where it has been very effective , deregulation is not likely to proceed as quickly .

( ene ) and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) is going to hurt , no doubt . but before discussions of "" systemic risk "" and other doomsday scenarios gain too much of a foothold , it ' s worth pointing out that the enron mess is no long term capital management . the death of the enron - dynegy deal is probably tantamount to the demise of enron , too . and that eventuality , should it come to pass , is going to have repercussions beyond one or two energy - trading companies . so it ' s fair enough that this news pulled down stocks of all kinds wednesday . yet the deal ' s demise and troubled enron ' s likely subsequent fate isn ' t a call on the broader value of stocks , whose fortunes remain tied to other fundamentals ( more on this later ) . the bottom line : a major corporation with about $ 62 billion of assets seems destined to fail . in some ways enron could indeed end up being like the implosion of hedge fund long term capital management , since so much of enron ' s assets are involved in trading . and it ' s for sure that the still relatively new industry of trading energy commodities like gas and oil - the so - called merchant energy business - is in shock and will have to regroup . stepping back a bit from the energy business , some big - name banks and other firms may end up with some bad debts if enron ends up in bankruptcy , as most industry observers now expect . individual investors , including mutual - fund holders unlucky enough to own some power - company shares , will also take a hit , as will some pension funds . all told , holders of enron stock have lost more than $ 60 billion this year , with the stock down more than 99 % . but the enron - dynegy deal ' s undoing , while painful and headline - grabbing , is not about to endanger financial markets across the globe , and there is where the analogy to a failed hedge fund thankfully breaks down . even at the epicenter of the enron debacle , there ' s no systemic risk : other merchant energy traders are already saying they ' ll be able to adjust , and s & p said in a conference call wednesday afternoon that it didn ' t expect to downgrade firms similar to enron . in fact , the biggest risks to stocks remain the same as they were yesterday or last week or last month . they ' re fundamentals unrelated to what ' s going on at enron , whose problems started with questionable off - balance sheet transactions . key among those risks , ironically , is stocks ' recent good fortune , which has driven share prices back up to levels that are unsustainable if history is any guide . this is big concern for technology shares but a host of other sectors , too . here ' s proof from elsewhere in wednesday ' s news : gap shares may be trapped near their 52 - week low , but according to prudential securities , which lowered its rating on gap to sell , they ' re still trading at 93 times projected 2001 earnings . another fundamental worry for stocks is the consumer economy , whose health is being hampered by the rising unemployment rate . u . s . payrolls , beefed up like never before during the 10 - year economic expansion , will be pared plenty more . fired people - or those who fear that fate - spend less and certainly pull back on equity investments . a third fundamental that will continue to weigh on stocks is the uncertainty about when exactly corporate earnings will return to meaningful growth . while companies of many stripes have begun to talk about bottoming out , when exactly they ' ll start to see real revenue gains again isn ' t clear . but you can bet that fundamental no . 2 ( the consumer economy ) is a factor here , and until revenues and thus earnings start advancing again , fundamental no . 3 ( share price valuations ) are also at risk . as for the enron debacle , bankruptcy might be the only way out . dynegy will probably have to cough up some money for breaking up the deal and cover some credit exposure to enron ( though it also stands to gain a natural gas pipeline owned by enron ) . chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns just over a quarter of dynegy and which also injected cash into enron , might have to kiss that money goodbye . houston might also suffer , as it ' s the home of both enron and dynegy . but the enron story is , despite all the headlines , a relatively contained one , and the challenges and risks for the rest of the stock market haven ' t changed . - by gene colter , dow jones newswires 201 . 939 . 2068 e : mail : gene . colter @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . in the money : enron trades heavily off the nyse by carol s . remond 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a dow jones newswires column new york - ( dow jones ) - numbers often speak volumes . or in the case of enron corp .

"" enron said wednesday afternoon that it was "" reviewing "" that claim in an apparent effort to keep dynegy from taking ownership . but even if dynegy does take control of the pipeline , the credibility of top dynegy managers , such as ceo chuck watson , will have been hit hard . if it turns out that dynegy does suffer badly from an enron crash , investors will complain that they should ' ve been told about the vulnerability much earlier . and if dynegy was too tied in to enron ' s fortunes , serious questions about watson & co . ' s risk management skills will be raised . kenny norton the ratings agency downgrades are doubly damaging for enron because rating agencies played a critical role in efforts to shore up the houston company . some observers , noting the steep discount on enron bond prices , had criticized the agencies ' reluctance to downgrade enron debt . but s & p and moody ' s said they wanted to see if the dynegy offer would revive enron . of course , as enron ' s core operations continued to sputter even after the deal was agreed to , the rating agencies ' position looked increasingly untenable . inevitably , if the deal doesn ' t go through and enron implodes , some people will blame s & p for enron ' s demise . s & p analyst todd shipman replies : "" we have always promised people that we wouldn ' t overreact , and i don ' t think we have overreacted . "" he adds that the turning point came when the rating agency stopped believing dynegy and others could revise the deal terms and find cash in time to stop the deterioration in enron ' s business . also , he doubted whether those working to salvage the merger would come up with the sort of provisions needed to keep enron viable . dynegy abandons enron deal shares of energy trader plunge , bankruptcy looms cbsmarketwatch . com lisa sanders 11 / 28 / 01 enron shares ( ene ) closed at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , having lost as much as 85 percent of their value on the day and having collapsed from a 52 - week high of almost $ 85 just 11 months ago . the company lost around $ 2 . 6 billion worth of market capitalization from tuesday to wednesday . close to 342 million enron shares had changed hands wednesday by the close , and the stock broke the all - time volume record of 309 million shares set by intel on sept . 22 , 2000 . dynegy ( dyn ) shares lost $ 4 . 92 , or 12 percent , to $ 35 . 97 . saying in a conference call that it had to "" protect "" its shareholders , dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with enron , citing "" enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , covenants and agreements in the merger agreement , including the material adverse change provision . "" company - specific problems ? dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said : "" some of the best deals are the ones that don ' t get done . "" "" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business , "" he said . dynegy president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom said that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for enron ' s diminished role in the business and that the industry has suffered "" no degradation , "" as he put it . "" there has been a clear flight to quality , and it ' s occurring as we speak , "" bergstrom said . "" dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform . "" dynegydirect is a platform much like enron ' s flagship enrononline , which it turned off wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online energy - trading platform , accounting for an average of $ 3 billion in trades a day . dynegy ' s trading exposure to enron is $ 75 million , and the company is no longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow houston industrial giant , bergstrom said . "" dynegy ' s customer - based , asset - backed energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us with earnings sustainability and future growth . "" watson said . as part of the deal , dynegy had the option to keep northern natural gas , enron ' s highly valued natural - gas pipeline , even if the agreement were terminated . the company said during the call that it would exercise that option . chevrontexaco ( cvx ) , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , originally gave $ 1 . 5 billion to the company in the transaction . dynegy used the money to purchase 100 percent of the preferred shares of northern natural gas . enron has 180 days from the date the merger agreement was signed , nov . 9 , to repurchase the pipeline system , watson said . enron said in a statement that it was reviewing dynegy ' s claim of rights to northern . enron representatives did not participate in the call , and dynegy executives said they had been advised against the customary practice of taking questions . enron said it has temporarily suspended payments "" other than those necessary to maintain "" its core energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those operations alive . "" to do this , we will work to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses , "" said enron chairman and ceo ken lay . enron told employees their questions would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks on friday . analysts said the next step for enron would likely be a bankruptcy filing . "" chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means , "" said john olson , a houston - based energy analyst . "" the key to salvaging the business is the level of debtor - in - possession financing they can get to allow them to trade in some realistic fashion . "" dip financing takes precedence over all other claims , he said . "" the equity people are now at the very bottom of the barrel , and the only people lower than them are [ the people who filed ] the stockholder suits , "" olson said . in a note to clients , analyst michael heim of a . g . edwards said that enron , without dynegy , has "" no value . "" "" enron . . . will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim said . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" ahead of this news , s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" moody ' s made its announcement of a rating cut to b 2 from baa 3 and said that enron ' s debt remains under review for additional downgrade . in its report , moody ' s cited the likelihood of a dynegy - enron breakup , fueled by enron ' s declining financial performance , as the reason for the downgrade . "" moody ' s . . . baa 3 rating was predicated on good prospects for completion of the merger with dynegy and reasonable prospects for marginally investment - grade characteristics of the merged entity , "" moody ' s wrote . "" furthermore , lack of confidence in enron by its trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting enron ' s core trading operations . "" for enron to survive , the credit agency said , it ' s imperative that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable . fitch , which had rated enron bbb - minus , lowered the rating to cc , which "" indicates that default of some kind appears probable . "" the u . s . treasury is keeping an eye on the impact the enron fallout is having on the credit markets , spokeswoman michele davis said wednesday . "" we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day , "" davis said . "" markets always fluctuate and we haven ' t seen anything extraordinary . "" treasury said that outside its surveillance of credit markets , it would refer any inquiries on energy trading to the federal energy regulatory commission or the commodity futures trading commission . earlier in the day dynegy , which had originally offered to buy enron for $ 9 billion in stock , confirmed tuesday that the two companies were discussing a new deal structure , and it said ahead of the credit - ratings and eventual termination news wednesday that discussions were continuing . "" i ' m not aware of any changes in any status of the merger , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said before the s & p announcement . the merger agreement contained a material adverse - affect clause that , if triggered , allowed dynegy to walk away from the deal . the decline in enron ' s stock price and information contained in the company ' s 10 - q filing of nov . 19 could had activated the clause , but olson said the s & p downgrade clearly fit the description of a material adverse affect . also wednesday , ubs warburg and rbc capital cut their ratings on enron , to "" hold "" from "" strong buy "" and from "" strong buy "" to "" buy - speculative , "" respectively . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . citi , morgan sink on enron exposure cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 greg morcroft new york ( cbs . mw ) - - j . p . morgan and citigroup shares fell wednesday as investors fretted about the banks ' exposure to troubled energy trader enron . enron shares collapsed after dynegy abandoned plans to buy the largest u . s . energy trader and standard & poor ' s cut its rating on the company to junk bond status . j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) fell $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 37 . 50 . fellow bank stock citigroup was the second biggest dow loser , dropping $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 47 . 80 . both firms have served as lenders and advisers to the embattled enron , which today saw its debt rating cut to junk status and its would - be acquirer dynegy walk away from the deal . early afternoon calls to citigroup were not returned , and a j . p . morgan spokesman declined to comment on reports of the bank ' s exposure to the situation . the wall street journal reported that both banks were attempting to finance dynegy ' s proposed purchase of enron , and had each committed roughly $ 700 million to $ 800 million in the form of various loans , about half of which were unsecured . the report noted the banks had also committed an additional $ 250 million in equity investments . enron deal falls apart enron ( ene ) shares ended the day at 61 cents , having lost as much 85 percent of their value . dynegy ( dyn ) shares closed down 12 percent at $ 35 . 97 . in a report wednesday , rating agency s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" shares could be worthless analyst michael heim at a . g . edwards said the downgrade of enron ' s debt by standard & poor ' s "" kills any chance of a deal "" with dynegy . he believes dynegy will have no problems using the debt downgrade to walk away from the deal without paying a break - up fee . "" without a deal , enron has no value , in our opinion , and will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim explained in a note to clients . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" he added the s & p downgrade will force enron to accelerate a debt payment of $ 3 . 9 billion , making it virtually impossible for enron trades to interact with most counterparties . u . s . bancorp piper jaffray estimated that enron represents about $ 500 million exposure to citigroup and $ 300 million to j . p . morgan chase . "" n our judgment , these credit facilities are well - collateralized , "" the firm said in a note , anticipating that non - performing assets would increase by $ 440 million at citi in the fourth quarter and $ 300 million at j . p . morgan , reflecting an enron bankruptcy . greg morcroft is new york news editor of cbs . marketwatch . com . at enron , best lay plans go awry commentary : from cabinet prospect to bankruptcy cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 by david callaway san francisco ( cbs . mw ) - - for ken lay , the collapse of enron corp . goes beyond one of the largest and swiftest corporate meltdowns in u . s . history . it represents the destruction of a lifetime of work that until only three months ago had the texas business leader and political rainmaker perched at the top of the corporate world , the most powerful energy mogul in history and an advisor to the president of the united states . it was less than a year ago that the 59 - year - old lay was being touted as incoming president bush ' s top choice to be treasury secretary , or at the very least , energy secretary . he ranked no . 36 on a list of the 50 best ceos last year published by worth magazine , after having put together a 240 percent return on shareholder value in enron ( ene ) stock over the last three years . enron ' s market value rose from $ 2 billion in 1985 , when lay created the company through a merger of two texas natural gas firms , to more than $ 80 billion earlier this year . but all of that power and prestige came crashing down over the last few months , culminating wednesday in a complete collapse of enron ' s shares in reaction to news that rival dynegy ( dyn ) would not step in to rescue the failing company . when the dust settled , enron ' s shares stood at 61 cents each , its total market value at $ 454 million . see full story . lay and enron now face an almost certain chapter 11 filing , which would be the biggest in u . s . history , and a slew of lawsuits as well as a federal investigation into how they built a tangled web of derivative trades and energy businesses into the empire that it was . a power broker unplugged now lay , a behind - the - scenes string puller in the corridors of power for more than a decade , will find out just how loyal his friends are , starting with bush . lay is a close friend of the bush family and has been one of the largest contributors to the president ' s political campaigns for president and texas governor . enron has pumped more than half a million bucks into bush ' s coffers over the years , including $ 100 , 000 for last year ' s presidential campaign , which was matched by lay and his wife . lay hired former cabinet members james baker and robert mosbacher after they left their positions with the cabinet of bush ' s father , george bush , in the early 1990 s . and with his political largesse came the benefits . lay had vice president cheney ' s ear earlier this year when cheney was presiding over the establishment of bush ' s energy policy , a process cloaked in secrecy that even today cheney refuses to shed light on . in may , he found himself in hot water after the new york times reported that lay called curtis hebert , then chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , and offered his support if hebert would change his views on electricity deregulation and embrace bush ' s push for retail energy competition . hebert said he refused , and had the impression his job was in jeopardy . lay later denied that he had threatened hebert ' s job security . whatever the case , hebert was later replaced as chairman of the agency by patrick wood , chairman of the texas public utility commission . lay was more successful in his adopted hometown of houston , where he was able to convince gov . bush to deregulate the state ' s electrical markets in 1999 and where , earlier this year , the houston astros began playing in their new stadium , enron field . that lay is a remarkable executive and power broker is without question . he took a rinky - dink natural gas company and in just over 16 years turned into the mightiest energy empire in american history , virtually inventing a new energy market , which enron itself controlled . bill gates would have been proud of the monopoly . but the speed with which the empire collapsed and the shambles that is left suggest that , at best , enron was not much more than an elaborate hedge fund that bet too much on itself . and now ken lay , rainmaker , has fallen back to earth . david callaway is executive editor of cbs . marketwatch . com",Safe Email

requirements that banks do.
You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable & interest free.

a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.
There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations

over one-half trillion dollars in

unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do

Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002
By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 
 It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
through his files and found the number for the Texas
Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
for fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
before US Airways announced its plans to file for
bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
better offer. ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't
many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
delve into the airline industry."" Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
with investments in Continental and America West. The
firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment
for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most
other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
fixes."" Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
this article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they
tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an
investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one
investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
early bets in industries like cable television and taking
stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
David does."" By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
party. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
businesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
that stretch. ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario
Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
investors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
needed its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
quadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
for luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
including investments made through March 1997, should
return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
- could return less than half that, this investor
estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
these investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
in the second fund, profits on these investments could
rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their
returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
funds won't return any capital"" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally
well,"" he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
replaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
artist of the industry. ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime
friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
better job."" At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat
kindred spirits."" The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
bankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.
Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.
Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor
friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
interest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
franchisees. ""We liked what they had to say about the human component of
the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other
owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
bankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
year. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
payment to E.On, based in Dï¿½sseldorf, Germany, was actually
more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
said. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
which it swapped for more stock in the company. ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said
Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
since the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
after the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
remains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman
seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the
steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,
Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,
Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. ï¿½ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6bHOW TO ADVERTISE

I sincerely appreciate IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1. I would ask the members of SVLUG to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print of the film. If my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members.I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of REVOLUTION OS. There are several reasons why I made the request, and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk. One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open Source movement would not be available for open viewings. Another SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter to Hobbyists. The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement, but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch. If I made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a vegetarian. I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting. As a result, I came to admire many aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movement's positive history. However, I do not think I should be punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by having my intellectual property misappropriated. More practically, my feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits. I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing is considered fair use. I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus. So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter. Personally, I believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to Open Source their IP. If the Open Source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings. We hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the DVD. I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt. Thus the importance of preserving the educational/institutional market.Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels. Well, in the case of REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. It's just me. I made and financed the film on my own. I have worked full-time for almost three years without a salary. The only way I will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.

"Hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion""Send me a free membership!""Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatServiceThat's all there's to it.We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.Looking forward to hearing from you!Sincerely, Hugh ZouP.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with

is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.. . . . .West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
be easier.. . . . .04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.. . . . .You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.. . . . .06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
will clear things up:NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and 
that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
Outlook Express.WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium

rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is
distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based

my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.

"I suppose the main surprise here is that AOL is coming clean at all. After
all, its long-running game of talking interop, and doing everything possible
to prevent open standards in this arena, seemed to have been working fine,
with most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions.http://www.quicken.com/investments/news/story/djbn/?story=/news/stories/dj/2
0020723/ON20020723000833.htmAmerica Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts
Updated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ETDow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its
instant-messaging service compatible with rival services.The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory
filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are
more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications
Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable
with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be
incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress
reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent
report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't
much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,
according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing
instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an
America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using
third-party software such as Trillian.America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized
for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The
company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at
interoperability.For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of
its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other
companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America
Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced
instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to
enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival
services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from
widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its
access to Time Warner cable systems.AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a
technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could
offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services
to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so
via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging
provider, using a common language.But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said
it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server
interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to
make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service
from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will
be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release
in August.IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't
involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of
messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat
customers use Apple software.""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short
term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide
interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven
Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to
the FCC.As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan
said Tuesday: ""It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard
nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's
rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to
provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding
America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,
similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday
implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the
technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus
Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,
msgs).But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope
and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further
significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr.
Teplitz.The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet
standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but
hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task
force representatives couldn't be reached.The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant
messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,
analyst with Jupiter Research.""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll
happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.""Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively
pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user
base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground
because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another
provider, as long as they can reach America Online users.But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,
America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and
Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL
has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its
system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are
catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base
rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's
base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of
users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.

actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm
Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.
Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. ""But it's not, they are really out there."" 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself."" 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo.""------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"typological classification a few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )",Safe Email

the actual rawhide ""libstdc++.so.5.0.0"" file to another directory, removed that
rawhide libstdc++ package, installed (rpm -ivh ) the Limbo II libstdc++ package
(new apt does not like it), make that symlink ""libstdc++.so.5"" point to that
rawhide file I moved earlier.Apt works again, dump the Limbo II rpms into a dir, run the ""genaptrep.sh rh73"",
but ""topdir"" arg had changed, edit script, rerun, makes apt repository for Limbo
II. Do ""apt-get --ignore missing -f dist-upgrade"". Apt wants to uninstall itself
because that rawhide libstdc++ package is not installed, but apt works for the
moment because of that symlink I made.Apt stays installed just long enough to issue the necessary ""dist-upgrade""
commands, several hours later, I have Limbo II, shiny and new. The install even
made that symlink point back to the correct libstdc++ file.Several hours after that, I read my mail and realize that ""null"" directory I kept
seeing while downloading Limbo II was not a fluke.Ahh, the joy. Repeat the above ....--

"" coors put its slogan , "" turn it loose , "" into spanish , where it was read as "" suffer from diarrhea . "" chicken magnate frank perdue ' s line , "" it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken , "" sounds much more interesting in spanish : "" it takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate .

"" and what if canada breaks up ? as long as they do it in peace . . . . . really , i think you use the wrong arguments here . i mean , do i use arguments like : look what china has done to tibet : by invading the country they have destroyed a very important cultural and religious heritage , the tibetans are forced to learn chinese , the tibetan culture will be lost soon . so please allow spanish in the u . s . ? no , i do n't use this argument either because you cannot compare a cat with a bird . > allowing ( for example ) native spanish speakers living in the > u . s . to avoid learning english as young as possible and as well as possible > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . allowing millions and millions of people in a modern , industrialized country like the u . s . to avoid learning any other language but their own greatly surprises me . really , from a practical point of view , and trying to agree with jack aubert , i would like to conclude with this . yes , of course plural mono-linguism is a problem . but does it make sense to expect that the half of the population of a country that has worse access to good education is going to make the step of learning two languages well ? as has been investigated in minority regions in europe , it has been proved that people can only learn a language well when they know their own language well . this is the reason the frisian language got reintroduced in the schools in frisia again in the seventies . frisia is a region in the north of holland where people speak frisian and dutch . most schools in the cities have dutch as a main language and frisian as a second language but in the country-side , at least the first three years , mathematics and everything is being taught in frisian and dutch is a second language . there is no separatism in frisia . in fact , the frisians are among the dutch to speak dutch best since a lot of other dutch only speak their local dialect and are ununderstandable for someone who comes from another region . since ( children of ) spanish speakers in the u . s . cannot go to a spanish school to learn their mother tongue thoroughly , they will never be able to learn english really well . it seems more realistic to expect that the ones who already speak their mother-tongue well and who have , generally speaking , better access to better education would learn spanish . let them become bilingual ( and maybe monolingual spanish in the end ? ? ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * jelly julia de jong * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + atw , o . k . i . h . jatstraat 26 * + dept . of general linguistics + 9712 ek groningen * + university of groningen + the netherlands * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | e - mail : julia @ let . rug . nl | | http : / / www . let . rug . nl / linguistics / jellydejong . html |",Safe Email

you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.

help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

"I'm sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them
blind of their ""intellectual Property""I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. ---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in
real-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users
actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.

http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.",Safe Email

"people to consider recruiting as requested , i ' ve created a list of people who : have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers / companies or i think would be a great asset to enron . i ' ve jotted down what i know about each person and i hope you find it useful . i ' ve organized it from most experienced to least experienced . if you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact them , just let me know . andy dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the pwc risk management practice . due to a falling out between andy and the partners ( not client related ) , he left the firm . he is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non - audit personnel , and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise . i have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to enron . the downside to andy is that he lives in denver , is used to travelling a lot , but , at the last time we spoke ( a few months ago ) , is not interested in leaving denver . his cell phone ( if still in use ) is 303 807 0040 . mark ( allan ) smith - mark is in the pwc energy risk management practice in houston . we worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for coral energy and equiva trading . prior to working at pwc , mark was at bp for 15 years where he had many different roles ( he worked as a crude trader , products trader , he worked in the risk management department , in the refinery itself as an engineer ) . mark was excellent to work with . clients are extremely impressed with his knowledge and background . i would highly recommend him for a leadership role at enron . i spoke to him yesterday and he is interested in talking with you . his direct number is 713 356 4233 . his cell phone number is 713 412 3890 . alan beaton - senior manager kpmg ' s systems control group ( irm ) . he works with my husband . i know him on a personal basis . he is trying to find opportunities outside of the audit / consulting area ( general line 713 319 2000 ) . marilyn chee - she currently works for equiva trading , manager in - charge of accounting for derivatives . her role has expanded to encompass fas 133 and all mtm accounting entries . she liases with all book heads ( crude and all products ) . in the past , she worked in the texaco internal audit department . she was my main contact at equiva when i was at pwc . she is extremely diligent and very professional . i enjoyed working with her greatly and have to say she was one of the best people i have worked with in the capacity of a client / professional relationship . marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at the alliance and is extremely well respected . she has had a difficult year as she is doing a job that should be done by 3 + people . she has mentioned to me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase , and has even mentioned finding another job . however , due to the fact that she is so well respected where she is , she may be difficult to recruit ( 713 277 6280 ) . if you contact her i would not want my name associated with it due to the pwc / alliance relationship . rebecca crider - she has been working at coral energy for approximately a year , reporting to the vp of risk control . before that she was an audit manager at aa . i have worked with her briefly and she seemed very conscientious . i do not know if she is looking or not , but its worth a try ! ( 713 230 3000 general line ) . kim nelson - she is a manager in the risk group at aa , and just transferred over from kpmg . i have not met her , but i did hear that she is not doing what she had expected at aa . i don ' t know her number but you could reach her at the general aa line . kevin schroder - audit manager at kpmg in the energy department . i do not know him , but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the audit / consulting area ( general line 713 319 2000 ) . keith considine - he is currently a senior accountant at pwc . he is the best senior pwc houston has , as well as probably one of the best people i have ever worked with ( the top of his class ) . although he only has 4 years of work experience ( all at pwc ) , he performs in a manager capacity . he worked for me on the coral energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both myself and the partners ( we all agreed that he is one of the best people any of us have seen or worked with ) . he is currently working on a project at one of pwc ' s clients to standardize their mid office processes . he definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of pwc , but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager . i actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at july 1 this year , but due to capacity issues , i don ' t expect that the promotion will be approved . since i ' ve only been with enron a short time and would like to continue good relations with pwc , i would appreciate whoever contacts keith to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name . his number is 713 356 5617 . dave simpson - analyst at koch energy in houston , has a degree in accounting and has work experience of about 9 months . he is very interested in leaving koch . i know him on a person basis , but have not worked with him . he is a good guy and very likeable . i don ' t have his phone number , but should be reachable through the general number for koch . admin assistants connie shugart - she is currently working at pwc as an administrative assistant . she is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for pwc ' s audit and internal audit service lines . she is very interested in enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here . i have not worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office i talked to her a number of times and was very impressed .

Saturday, July 20, 2002Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.Somebody's watching youYou better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.Also of note
A handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are advancing techniques once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, in ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping networks than were previous efforts...Apple released the final version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is planning to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restrict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction fraud, a Virginia man was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for life prison sentences for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, a group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, finalized licensing terms for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manageable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are considering a joint venture to pepper the United States with wireless ""hot spots.""Want more?

 | Read Full Story Scripting flaw threatens Web serversA flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

Russian firm points out new Adobe flawThumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

"re : 5 . 1433 comparative method i re-read newmeyer 's original posting ( date 30 nov 94 ) and noticed that it has an implicit attack on the notion of "" basic word order "" for comparative purposes . this flows from his earlier question on how basic word order is variously defined by various analysts , implying that it lacks precision . to the extent that i have understood the responses so far , no one has responded to this particular point , so here goes - - basically in agreement with newmeyer , but with some criticism of the assumed larger implications for comparative reconstruction of syntax . i ' ll stick to what i know about linguistic events in europe since i expect the events to be more familiar to most readers than events in other language families , so that my examples may speak to readers ' previous ideas about particular linguistic events referred to below , and , under the best circumstances , provoke further discussion . to anticipate , the notion of basic word order is too simple-minded ( simplistic ? ) for diachronic purposes . fn : "" could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? "" bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j ' ai rien fait etc . are n't they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of "" basic "" word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose "" basic "" means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can't be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : "" should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? "" bw : newmeyer 's reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that "" basic "" word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if "" basic "" word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct "" proto-basic "" word orders , such that "" minor "" word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as "" proto-minor "" word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n't work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as "" basic "" and "" minor "" for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in "" basic "" word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of "" basic "" word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing "" basic "" word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the "" basic "" word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n't need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : "" i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : "" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . "" "" bw : [ why with "" increasing frequency "" ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in "" what / hullo , are you kidding me ? "" ( such a marker "" ibai "" is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has "" me : "" ) . do n't get me wrong . i ' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i ' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it 's variable in gothic where it 's variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as "" evolution of the idiolect "" is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic "" basic "" word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if "" basic "" only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a "" minor "" postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i ' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of "" languages "" in the world all together . however , this is n't really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i ' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing "" accusative "" definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and "" ergative "" definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : "" and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . "" bw : i think the thrust of fn 's suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably "" unlikely or impossible "" , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think "" unlikely "" is more accurate than "" impossible "" depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov 's new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels "" cataclysmic "" syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn 's suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson 's caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it 's ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former 's preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are "" basically "" the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji",Safe Email

The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.

After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil LibertyAugust 4, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil
A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John
Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal
government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and
punish ""the terrorists among us."" The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with
wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions
of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating
immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or
fighting for the enemy. The government's effort has produced few if any law
enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been
released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.
But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being
waged in federal courthouses around the country, that
experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance
between individual liberties and national security. The main combatants are the attorney general and federal
prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,
immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil
libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,
with federal judges in between. The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As
it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,
the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed
back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's
tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.
Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to
hold two American citizens without charges in military
brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map
for how they might even challenge their detentions. In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the
reach of government power have occurred against the
backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current
restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by
historical standards and in light of the risks the nation
faces. The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.
People held simply for immigration violations have objected
to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,
and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on
what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those
thought to have information about terrorist plots, have
argued that they should not be held to give testimony in
grand jury investigations. Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two
Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the
government contends is more direct involvement with
terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be
fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's
representation and a chance to challenge their detentions
before a civilian judge. So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered
secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,
and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington
ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be
made public under the Freedom of Information Act. ""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the
decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic
society."" A senior Justice Department official said the detentions
had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to
""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that
had been disrupted. But he said that department officials
believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and
disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on
whether the government may jail material witnesses while
they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In
Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow
Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. ""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer
them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent
judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a
professor at the University of Minnesota and former
executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply
skeptical."" These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet
been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that
appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more
sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,
reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a
lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider
additional evidence and arguments. But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the
government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role
in reviewing the government's designation of an American
citizen as an enemy combatant. The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of
the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were
cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of
laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before
being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals
court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant
attorney general under President Bush, saying that the
administration's refusal to identify the people it had
detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. ""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the
mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of
those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said.
""We must be very careful in this country about taking
people into custody without revealing their names."" Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from
Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was
taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he
said, those detained by the United States were not being
secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek
lawyers. ""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only
thing we will not do is provide a road map for the
investigations."" According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than
1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on
immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81
remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were
about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other
detainees were held on various state and federal criminal
charges. President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected
foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no
such charges have been brought yet. Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding
in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a
British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his
shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very
establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of
diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of
American justice."" Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,
added: ""This is the most profound shift in our legal
institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -
it has taken place without engaging any broad public
interest whatsoever."" Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the
University of Chicago Law School, have written that the
Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to
civil liberties especially compared with changes during the
times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What
has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil
liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. The Secrecy U.S. Says Hearings 
Are Not Trials Ten days
after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the
nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping
instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out
to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. ""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all
other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The
courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no
family, and no press."" ""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or
denying whether such a case is on the docket."" The government has never formally explained how it decided
which visa violators would be singled out for this
extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the
designations could not be reviewed by the courts. But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and
Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for
example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious
neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
only a few of these detainees had any significant
information about possible terrorists. As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of
legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking
legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have
ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable
skepticism about the government's justifications for its
detention policies generally. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the
hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on
violations that in the past would not have resulted in
incarceration. ""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical
departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly
shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice
Department's say-so."" Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had
it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that
threatens to end the secret proceedings. Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa
14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than
a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven
an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and
Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him
about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.
Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa
soon cost him 40 days in custody. When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his
detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.
Zeidan's cousin and reporters. The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal
court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.
In March, the government dropped the ""special interest""
designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,
and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration
charges against him will be considered in the fall. ""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other
visa violators were held as long as six or seven months
before being deported or released. Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,
which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. ""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr.
Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to
these hearings they would see that nothing went on except
multiple adjournments and delay."" Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An
I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's
case and in similar cases. He said the immigration service had always detained people
without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He
added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a
visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
sure the person was not involved in terrorism. ""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days
and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he
was a terrorist,"" the official said. The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once
reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers
contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on
secrecy and executive power. Its main argument is that the courts have no role because
immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely
administrative hearings that can be closed at will. Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he
was flabbergasted by this suggestion. ""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at
stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being
told where to live."" But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,
Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for
counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,
outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for
total secrecy. ""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous
in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist
groups,"" he said. This rationale for withholding information, sometimes
called the mosaic theory, is controversial. ""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said,
""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal
district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,
ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation
hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is
able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case
basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the
month before, though that case involved only a single
detainee. The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge
Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,
which will hear arguments in September, declined to do
that. A number of news organizations, including The New
York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in
support of the newspapers. The government then asked the United States Supreme Court
to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively
unusual move given that the case was not before it for any
other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting
that it might have more sympathy for the government's
arguments. The Witnesses Rights Violated, 
Lawyers Contend Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled
two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul
Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They
were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000
in cash and had also shaved their body hair. The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used
box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and
had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair
from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said
there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian
men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. But even though government officials told reporters that
the men had been detained as material witnesses, their
lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on
immigration violations. The distinction is important because a material witness
warrant brings the automatic appointment of a
government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have
to supply a visa violator with counsel. As a result, the authorities were able to question each of
the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer
present, their current lawyers say. Like some of the people who were picked up as material
witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails
in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.
Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,
their lawyers say. ""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never
bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,""
Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an
interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney
at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.
investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main
inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his
client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a
day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire
questions from three or four different people."" Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men
of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in
June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting
sentencing. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men
consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his
Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote,
adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.
The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,
would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally
of the government's tactics: ""I don't see any violation of
any rule, regulation, or law. ""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he
said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every
available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole
field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole
field. ""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate
and disrupt,"" he added. Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen
material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being
detained. But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred
intense criticism. Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District
Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain
people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in
order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of
the statute."" Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when
witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for
grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin
said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that
he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal
investigation."" Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of
Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the
government's use of the material witness statute in grand
jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's
reasoning. Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief
Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every
man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses
during investigations are proper. The War Captives No Lawyers Allowed 
Under U.S. Label Yasser Esam Hamdi, a
Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably
an American citizen by virtue of having been born in
Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind
of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in
reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged
with something akin to a war crime. Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in
Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal
judges who has shown resistance to the government's
approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant""
by the president, all judicial review ceases. Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,
has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and
ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal
public defender, to be allowed to visit him without
government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar
said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it.
He said the government ""could not cite one case where a
prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United
States District Court, who was held incommunicado and
indefinitely."" But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge
Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the
government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,
more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of
foreign and military affairs. ""The authority to capture those who take up arms against
America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J.
Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at
the breadth of what the government was asserting when he
asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that
the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's
stature as an enemy combatant?"" The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide
the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by
which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.
But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with
the standards. Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the
government closely on those standards. The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far
as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge
to normal judicial procedures. Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like
Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig
after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike
Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield
by the military but on United States soil by civil law
enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. After his detention as a material witness based on
suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and
information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred
to military custody. ""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr.
Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can
arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an
enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the
courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him
or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any
evidence.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865&ei=1&en=c82350bcf915e44eHOW TO ADVERTISE

server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

"" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions . the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment . certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors . since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships . mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post . mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests . investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur . for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s . currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . october 23 , 2001 where did the value go at enron ? by floyd norris new york times what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ? wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote senior columnist thestreet . com 10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt url : enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market . the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance . enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction . enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text . instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called "" structured finance arrangement . "" the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow . this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : "" in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . "" according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares . enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future . but there are two possible problems with this theory . first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance . second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down . why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : "" at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . "" the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices . but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been "" in the money "" , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 . maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where . presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .",Safe Email

High-Altitude Rambos
By BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake
Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in
one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the
U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from
Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section
began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do
with Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back
to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight
man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer
refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying
out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him
in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite
jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight
attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,
already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were
not ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The
marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and
remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any
reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try
to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who
disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were
terrorists on the plane.""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized
cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an
aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire
in a shootout.""Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her
husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that
there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore
did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the
bathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When
the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into
custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals
grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that
anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where
he was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.
Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into
custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening
hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were
eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.
McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,
which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the
incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.
Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too
closely.""If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters
are headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I
had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I
was about to be beaten up or killed.""Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and
he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful
detention.""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said
Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in
this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of
security.""--

"wasn't sure if that ever started up. what irc server is #ilug on?Regards, Shane-----Original Message----- From: Niall O Broin [mailto:niall@linux.ie] Sent: 19 July 2002 15:36 To: ilug@linux.ie Subject: [ILUG] OSI protocol There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel & Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma find it interesting.The top of the poster refers you to www.decodes.com for a more up to date online copy of the poster.

"sum : wh animal i recently asked about whether one says ' who ' or ' what ' to ask what variety of animal in contexts such as : a . a person walks into a room with a swollen arm . you say : ' wh - bit you ? ' or b . you see an animal disappearing into the woods . you say : ' wh - is that ? ' the following languages ( thanks to the people listed for the info ) seem to use ' what ' only , although in context a gave some of the respondents did not like either alternative . greek ( a speaker who wished not to be identified by name ) finnish , swedish ( jussi karlgren ) english , hebrew ( david gil ) dutch , french ( bert peeters ) georgian ( ivan derzhanski ) german ( john peterson ) norwegian , swedish ( marit julien ) danish ( soren harder ) i would add polish to this list , based on my own judgements . ivan derzhanski adds bulgarian to the list , his testimony being particularly valuable , since he feels a clear contrast between bulgarian and russian here , but greg gouzev says that he would use ' who ' in context a ( but not b ) . on the other hand , dale russell reports that in cheyenne : "" people are all animate , but so are rocks , trees and leaves ( but not branches ) and the sun . animals are all animate , so far as i know . some body parts are animate , roughly those that are voluntarily movable . noses are not animate , fingers are . if you point to a rock and ask "" what is this ? "" , a native speaker will correct you , and say "" who is this ? "" , then answer the question - - at least that was my experience , in a field-methods type language learning experience . "" jonathan bobaljnik reports that itel ' men sometimes uses ' who ' and sometimes ' what ' for referring to animals . unfortunately , there 's very little data on the language , so i can't be very specific about the conditions determining which you get when . the clearest example of a language that uses ' who ' is russian ( in a striking contrast to closely related polish and bulgarian ) , as stated in standard works on this language and confirmed to me by alex eulenberg , ari solovyova , and ivan derzhanski ( but i must add that daniel radzinski reports that at least one speaker he spoke with gave different judgements ) . i find particularly interesting the fact that russian linguists working on other languages routinely note this difference between russian and whatever language they are describing ( i have seen this probably dozens of times in russian grammars or dictionaries of various languages of the former empire ) . barbara abbott noted a reference i had missed : chomsky 's in _ current issues in linguistic theory _ ( mouton , 1964 ) , p . 40 , notes that we cannot say "" what is eating its dinner ? ( the cat or the dog ) "" , and that ' who ' is also not natural in that context . a lot of the respondents indicated similar difficulties in other languages . i have not kept track of these , but they include french , danish , etc . , as noted by various respondents ( including frank gladney on english ) . cathy ball says that older forms of english sometimes use ' what are you ? ' in addressing a human being . special thanks to osten dahl who first pointed out to me that you have to define very particular contexts for this question , since in many contexts many lgs allow neither ' who ' nor ' what ' . alexis manaster ramer",Safe Email

"k . polgardi , vowel harmony vowel harmony . an account in terms of governement and optimality by krisztina polgardi vowel harmony deals with some theoretical problems concerning the phenomenon of vowel harmony , in a framework combining insights from government phonology , optimality theory and lexical phonology . the study introduces and motivates the general framework and examines three issues . the first concerns the typology of vowel harmony systems and how an element-based feature theory , comprised of the three elements i , a and u and supplemented by the property of headedness , can account for all the different types of harmony . the second concerns the domain of harmony and the question of how to handle disharmonicity in the proposed model . the third involves the so-called neutral vowels , i . e . those vowels in a system that do not have a harmonic counterpart . it is claimed that the behaviour of neutral vowels can be predicted from their segmental make-up and from particular properties of the vowel systems involved . polgrdi argues that the theory of government phonology ( a principles-and - parameters approach ) needs to be supplemented by constraint ranking , because certain types of phenomena cannot be accounted for otherwise . since ranking is shown to be necessary , language variation can now be exclusively expressed by this device , and the notion of param - eters can be abandoned . polgrdi also argues that a non-derivational version of the strict cycle condition also needs to be incorporated into the theory to account for so-called derived environment effects ( of which disharmonicity is shown to be an example ) . 1998 . xii + 200 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 046 - 5 . paperback . lot interna - tional series 3 . hil / leiden university dissertation . price for individuals ordering directly from the publisher : nlg 36 , 90 , excl . vat and p&p . holland academic graphics , the hague < http : / / www . hag . nl > rint sybesma holland academic graphics po box 53292 2505 ag the hague the netherlands fax : + 31 70 448 0177",Safe Email

options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
to use :)Julian

The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'. It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading '%'. That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation. If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.Confused?Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'? Here's some of what I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes:Line 46: - macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only.Line 49: - bail on %files macro.Hmm. So, there is no %files macro?Line 172-174: - add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib"" incompatibilities.I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same. The important things to remember are: 1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string. If you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message: error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib 2.

"Hi,I'm going to be using MySQL in an upcoming project (and probably
buying their support license), and I'm wondering if anyone else
has used any libraries to link a proprietary C++ project to a
MySQL database. From what I can see on the MySQL website, their
MySQL++ library is under the GPL, but there's also some documents
which list it as under the LGPL.Anyone got any experience with this, or has used a different
library to link C++ and MySQL under Linux?Regards,Vin

she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.;-)

"The Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

> For(a=0;a {

> };Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using
C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
caching for you.I do not think this is possible in C, though?You could write the same code fragment as:
============================
for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a<l;a++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(b==l-4)
        do_something();
}
============================Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very
long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be:
============================
char c;
char* p;
for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(*(p+4)==0)
        do_something();
}
============================This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance
because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do
array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as
most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code
illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer
Java for most programming tasks. :)- Matthew

[ Messages on the IEDR-FORUM list at the time don't support 
  your assertion ]As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and
uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had
two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three
working correctly. Marvellous.

ship to US only"".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).Later,

  3. Skins, Skins and More Skins  
  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
  ------------------------------------
  
  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
  not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult
  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
  way to get their content in front of new audiences.
  
  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
  animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank
  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
  ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
  episodes to come.* Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the
  DivX Showcase:
  
  Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
  -------------------------------  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
  ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would
  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
  Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with
  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
  games in the near future....* Watch the ""Warcraft III"" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:

you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The

">>From the Desk of Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria,
 
Lagos-Nigeria.
 
 
 
ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
 
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
 
 
Dear Sir,
 
I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
 
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
 
We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.
  
Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
 
Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
 
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
 Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 
 
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
 
 
 
Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria.

"summary : ' typewriter ' and "" canadian "" raising i recently asked , as i do periodically , if anyone knows of speakers who have different vowels in _ rider _ and _ writer _ ( i . e . , who have canadian raising , so called , for the diphthong / ai / ) but who use the vowel of _ rider _ in the second syllable of _ typewriter _ . i received a fair amount of mostly irate comments from people who thought this was impossible . however , i have found one speaker ( who happens to be a linguist but not a phonologist ) who has this pronunciation . as it happens he is not from ontario , but from illinois , but i believe that his existence strengthens the case for the hitherto purely hypothetical account i have proposed of how joos came to "" invent "" the non-existent ontario dialect in which supposedly _ writer _ and _ rider _ were homophonous . a careful reading of joos shows that the only example he actually cites is _ typewriter _ , not _ writer _ ! i thus believe that there must have been more speakers who said _ writer _ with a higher vowel , but both _ rider _ and _ typewriter _ with a lower one than my sole informant , and that this sporadic pronunciation is what led to the birth of the whole myth about rule ordering in canadian english , which persists till now as the example of crucial rule ordering in the phonological literature . it may not be as glamorous as the eskimo snow word myth , but there it is .",Safe Email

What I meant, was a time-specific occurence.  Sure, there are other

willing to eliminate the ability to speak in public -only- for the
side that doesn't agree with the political force, and make that part
of the 1st amendment, the parties -are- screaming and shouting over
political figures because they cannot be heard (to those figures) in
any other way.MF> I don't think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the

walk away.   NObody compells them to stand there, I'll agree fully.
But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against
policies, actions and grievances.Again.  If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.--

"comparative method and geoff pullum i have a problem : geoff 's posting sounds like it assumes ( a ) that there are only two sides to the issues under discussion and ( b ) that one of them is "" orthodox "" and the other one ( the i am on , apparently ) little short of crazy , the suggestion being that those who defend the idea that there are linguistic relationships to be discovered beyond the ones which were known in 1840 or some such cut-off date ( the so-called "" remote "" or "" distant "" connections ) might go so far as to accept that all of greenberg 's muskogean data are wrong and yet to maintain that muskogean is amerind ( without citing any new data ! ) . i think the reality is quite different . for example , victor golla , karl teeter , and i ( although we have been debating some methodological issues relevant to nostratic ) are actually very close on most issues ( except the ones under discussion , apparently ) and in particular on most issues concerning the proposed amerind grouping . there are lots of historical linguists with different ( and crossclassifying ! ! ) views on these matters ( for example , eric hamp has been widely quoted on his views against nostratic , yet he has been a staunch defender of altaic and of a connection between luoravetlan and eskimo - aleutian ; many of those who like nostratic do not like amerind ; and so on . i think each case deserves to be examined on its merits , the whole idea of contrasting "" orthodox "" ( or "" mainstream "" ) with "" remote "" or "" distant "" comparisons is without foundation and can lead to further needless polarization , and finally i feel that methodological issues and substantive ones should be discussed separately ( and that the latter are the more important , even if the former are often the more seductive ) . and to close on a positive note ( consonant with the spirit of the season ) , if karl teeter and i can reach the point where our major remaining disagreements are ( a ) whether in principle one could or could not write a comparative grammar of anglo - french , and ( b ) whether in fact the work done to date on nostratic is sufficient to taking it as a working hypothesis that at least indo - european , uralic , altaic , kartvelian , and afro - asiatic are related and going further , then i think we have achieved considerable progress ( and i am not even sure we even disagree about these points any more , for as the discussion goes on , more and more mutual misunderstandings seem to disappear ) . there will , of course , remain a lot of hard work to be done , on these and even more on other language families , but i do not see why the inevitable disagreements should be considered any more of a problem than the disagreements within the indo - europeanist community about the different versions of the laryngeal theory or about the glottalic theory , etc .",Safe Email

is the appointment of a new Pumpking. No, not Hugo van der Sanden, who

talking about the inimitable Michael Schwern, who's now holder of the

"Dear jm@netnoteinc.com :
Did you miss out on 
ENVC, UP 280%?, PRCT, UP 300%? HUMT, UP 200% and others? 
NOW What are you waiting for?
Here's another pick - 
Another potential big Play

Â Â Â 
Â 
   MicroCap  MarketingÂ PLAY OF THE WEEKÂ   for ourÂ investors 
      this   week 
      is NANNACO, INC.    (OTCBB: NNCO   ).Â  If you tuned 
      in 
      to our last two picks, you would have noticed that , Â PRCT wentÂ fromÂ a close 
      of $.025 to a high of $0.12.Â  That's a 300% gain in just two days.Â  
      Our other 
  pick, HUMT, almost gained over  200%. PLAY OF THE WEEK tracks stocks on downward trends, foresees 
      bottom and notify our subscribers of it potentialÂ upward movement.Â  We 
      also look for newly trading companies, and stocks that by comparing 
      trading history and shares in the marketplace we believe have great levity 
      upward.

 Â Â  MicroCap 
      Marketing PLAYOF THE WEEK.Â  Our trademark is our 
      uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their 
      rebound and upward trend.Â  Most of the stocks we track rebound and 
      peak within just two days, giving investors opportunity to make a few 
      bucks back in such a highly volatile market.Â  We don't believe the 
      market is such as to take any long-term positions right now.Â  But in 
      a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities for short-term stabs 
      (gains) are abundant.Â  When the question today seems to be which way 
      is up, we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way---it's 
      all a matter of 
timing.

support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:> I don't see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan's

its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that

of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle

and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.Owen

I've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason. Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't live this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonâ€“one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaskaâ€“a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryâ€“have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Natureâ€“and lootersâ€“take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the ice patchâ€“and scores of others around the regionâ€“revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell and St. Elias mountain rangesâ€“the United States' most glaciated terrainâ€“and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're probably about the only ones happy about it.""",Safe Email

"summary : in other words dear netters , i have posted several queries a few months ago . about ten members of the linguist list answered me by e-mails . i must show great thanks especially to prof . welchsler , prof . jewett , prof . edwards ( who sent me examples of iow from london - lund corpus ) , prof . patrikis , prof . spackman , prof . macrakis , prof . alvarez - caccamo , prof . harris , prof . huettner , and dr . georgia green ( who introduced me "" two types of convention in indirect speech acts "" by j . l . morgan , contained in the volume : _ syntax and semantics , vol . 9 : pragmatics _ edited by peter cole ( 1978 , new york : academic press ) . the following are my own summary . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in this summary , i propose the hearer 's implicature / implication - interpretation process ( prof . alvarez - caccamo 's suggestion ) , which constrains on the use of in other words ( iow ) in english . i would distinguish between speaker 's intended implicature and hearer 's interpreted implicature . thus , speaker a may have the intention to implicate x , but hearer b may very well fail to recognize such impli - cature or else may interpret some other . even if b correctly interprets a 's intention , b 's interpretation depends largely upon the context and / or background assumption . the use of iow is such a case . a dictionary edited by ball ( 1986 ) calls such usage "" inferential function "" , though he uses the term rather informally in the dictionary . i will follow his terminology just for the sake of convenience . the inferential use of iow frequently occurs between the two people 's dialogue . ( 1 ) a : i ' m afraid there is n't much i can help you with . b : _ in other words _ , you do n't want to be bothered . although the interpretation process of ( 1 ) is very close to what is called "" conventional "" use , i . e . it might be processed spontaneously , without any inferential process in the hearer 's mind , b guesses a 's real intent , which is not directly inferred from a 's utterance , but indirect - ly from a 's implicature . in order for b to necessitate iow , b exploits his / her background assumption / encyclopedic knowledge , implicating that a is busy now , or a does n't feel at ease with b . let the implicature just explained be c , then a sequential flow of consciousness / inferential process such as a $ @ "" * ( jc $ @ "" * ( jb emerges . iow is a visible index of the hearer 's implicature-interpretation process . speaker / hearer 's background assumption varies between common sense and the knowledge which is only valid between the speaker and hearer . ( 2 ) a : i love schubert 's late piano sonatas . b : _ in other words _ , you do n't like the beethoven sonatas ? iow in ( 2b ) is derived by the use of a restricted set of background assumption in which b has already admired the beethoven sonatas . b assumes that a is also an admirer of beethoven , but contrary to b 's assumption a declares an admiration for schubert . so , b feels criticism in a 's words . b 's background assumption becomes an old information , conflates a 's new information and enables iow to create a = b . "" non - conventional "" , rather complicated use of iow is the following . ( 3 ) a : i ' m going to kill you . b : _ in other words _ , you 'd like it if i moved my car . for example , b 's car stands in the way of a 's car , so that a gets infuriated at b . the situation like the above gets a to utter such harsh words ; kill you . a 's real intent , in this case implicature / implication , is "" i ' m going to kill you if you do n't move your car "" , or simply "" move your car "" , which is labelled as c again . b , beginning with iow , paraphrases c by b 's own words . again in order for b to use iow , h / she must infer that a assumes / implicates c . background assumption mitigates b 's processing effort . if not , b processes too much effort and cannot interpret a 's words . b 's job here is to process the flow of the dialogue like a $ @ "" * ( jc $ @ ! a ( jb . b 's failure to process / infer the flow of the dialogue sometimes occurs . ( 1 ' ) a : i ' m afraid there is n't much i can help you with . b ' : ? _ in other words _ , you need to be helped . in the context where a really needs help , s / he does n't bother to say that s / he can't help b ' . if a 's hands are full of the parcels and he visibly needs help , so that s / he says s / he can't help b ' , there is a possibility of b ' saying it is you who need to be helped . however , this is a very insulting comment , because b ' actually implies that if you can't help me , you are not a capable person . so , you are the one who needs help . another completely misled example of inference is the following . ( 4 ) a : sorry , i can't help you now , because i ' m busy . b : * _ in other words _ , you ' re busy . unacceptability of b comes from a 's words _ because i ' m busy _ , where a has already spoken out his own implicature c . mere repetition cannot be allowed in iow 's case . if something extra can be implied in b 's response , type of ( 4 ) is ok . ( 5 ) a : sorry , i can't help you now . b : _ in other words _ , you can't . ( - ) ' you really can't . ' ) in summary , an utterance "" a . in other words , b "" has an inferential process / hearer 's interpretive process "" a $ @ "" * ( jc ; in other words c $ @ ! a ( jb "" . iow can be campared with 's o ' and ' then , ' etc . the following results are the above contributors ' reactions . ( * ) means that there are some who judge a sentence acceptable and others unacceptable . ' so ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 6 ) a . there was $ 5 in his wallet . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } he had n't spent all the money . b . she 's your teacher . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } you must respect her . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 7 ) playing the french horn . a : anyway , the horn makes funny noises . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } it 's a treacherous instrument , is n't it ? it 's something that is very hard for you to control . why is that ? too much spit , or what ? b : i ' m glad you ' ve used that term . because it 's not difficult . it is treacherous . so are the players , of course . but that 's another story . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 8 ) tom ate condemned meat . { _ so _ / * _ in other words _ } he felt ill . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 9 ) bill insulted mary . { _ so _ / _ in other words _ } she left . in contrast with resultative 's o 's ' in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , two 's o 's ' in ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are sequential . in the case of iow , one is ok and the other is out . ( 9 ) can be interpreted that bill 's insulting mary always leads to her leaving ( here ) , so that iow is permitted . iow in ( 8 ) is n't ok because eating condemned meat always equals to his feeling ill , in which case iow in such situation is redundant / meaningless / uninformative . ' then ' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 10 ) an insurance man visits a girl he knows . he has brought her a policy application for signature . they talked about her husband . girl : i ' m expecting robert home soon . insurance salesman : oh ! why ? is he in trouble ? g : no . he 's thinking of setting up in business on his own . is : oh , good for him . g : you think it 's a good idea ? is : yes , why not ? g : small businesses are going bust all over the place . is : so , there are millions of people on the dole right now who thought they were safe and secure working for someone else . { _ so _ / _ in other words _ / ( * ) _ then _ } , now 's the time to have a go . there 's nothing else to lose anyway . g : think so ? is : yes .

  beberg@mithral.com-----------------Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and BytesBy Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""

"workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de",Safe Email

"One of the main strands of this 'modernisation' is to have all stations on a 'retained' basis at night. Basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire, the fire-fighters will be summonsed by pagers, the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions. The main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night. However, the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire-fighters' strike all occurred at night. Over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren't on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come. Currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live/work within one mile of the station. How they will apply this to whole time fire-fighters is still unclear. A good friend of mine is a station officer in Hampshire and currently lives 20 miles from his station so how he'll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery.  And I can't see many fire-fighters living within a mile of some of the inner London stations.DaveTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

"sintassi comparata dell ' accordo participiale ramanzo michele loporcaro sintassi comparata dell ' accordo participiale romanzo rosenberg & sellier , torino , 1998 isbn 88-7011 - 719 - 7 , 272 pages , lit . 65 . 000 address of the publisher : via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino grosenb @ tin . it ( credit cards accepted ) this book offers a comprehensive account of romance past participle ( pp ) agreement in verbal periphrastics , a much-debated topic in romance linguistics as well as in theoretical syntax . its main bulk consists of a systematic inventory of agreement systems throughout romance ( chs . 3 - 4 ) , which is unprecedented as to both empirical coverage and level of detail . beside the standard languages , dialects ( especially , but by no means exclusively , italo - romance ones ) are considered thoroughly , based in part on first-hand data . one of the basic points of this work is that no sensible account of pp agreement can be arrived at without in-depth consideration of dialect variation . more than sixty different systems are taken into account : for virtually all of them the discussion is not limited to selected syntactic constructions , but rather encompasses the whole set of verbal periphrastics ( both perfective and passive ) consisting of auxiliary + pp . among the agreement systems analyzed here several have not been previously described . the presentation of romance syntactic variation in chapters 3 and 4 is preceded by two introductory chapters and followed by three more theoretically oriented ones . ch . 1 deals with traditional accounts of pp agreement in romance linguistics and shows why a fresh look at the phenomena at issue is needed . ch . 2 introduces the aims and method of the present monograph , which is cast in the framework of relational grammar . after the assessment of dialect variation in pp agreement ( chs . 3 - 4 ) , ch . 5 shows that the analysis developed to account for it naturally projects onto diachrony . the steps through which pp agreement has evolved over time from latin to romance are shown to closely match the parametric options evidenced by synchronic geographic variation . ch . 6 compares the achievements of the present study with competing approaches to pp agreement developed within the principles and parameters approach ( or earlier versions of generative grammar ) . one of the main results of this comparison is the recognition of the fact that proposals put forward by generative grammarians - in spite of seeming differences , due to the theoretical machinery used - are very much in keeping with the descriptive tradition discussed ( and criticized ) in ch . 1 . ch . 6 also contains a discussion of pp agreement in the acquisition of italian as a first language . this domain of empirical data can be naturally unified with dialectal and diachronic variation under the approach developed here . ch . 7 finally synthesizes the results and elaborates on the internal articulation of the parametric conditions involved in pp agreement throughout romance varieties . the concluding table ( 29 ) displays in half a page all the syntactically relevant information that is both necessary and sufficient to exhaustively characterize pp agreement through space and time across romance . finally , a list of keywords for this book would have to include a number of related issues that must be dealt with in connection with pp agreement and which are in fact repeatedly touched upon in the seven chapters . among these , auxiliary selection and the contrast between agreement of pps and of adjectival predicates figure most prominently . other topics discussed range from the syntactic nature of clitics to the representation of reflexives , impersonal constructions , and existentials , to mention just a few . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",Safe Email

a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.--j.

I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
other people.  And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I
grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
wasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made
lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. 
Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It
isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
wealthy.

You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"".  Smart doesn't make
you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
their energy elsewhere than being ""rich"".  But I don't know too many
really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
what wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
but with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  ""Old wealth"" is
incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
long-lived exceptions.It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
into it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
expend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are
wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
exaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those
people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {

            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less

"glow ' 99 call for papers : glow 1999 the glow 99 colloquium will be organized by the research center for general linguistics ( zas ) in berlin from 29th to 31st march 1999 . the conference will then continue in potsdam on 1st april with parallel workshops organized by the potsdam university and lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) . themes of the conference main colloquium : universals workshops : phonetics in phonology sources for universals technical aspects of movement calls : the colloquium : universals the search for universals has always been at the center of interest in generative linguistics . fundamental claims about universal properties of language are what we build into the very architecture of the theory of ug : primitives ( features etc . ) , combinatorial operations ( merge ) , the operation ' move ' , interfaces with extralinguistic systems ( lf , pf ) , etc . alongside such formal universals , we also seek substantive universals in inventories , markedness patterns , feature hierarchies etc . such facts may reflect properties of ug itself or derive from extralinguistic sources . recent growth in crosslinguistic study opens new opportunities for extending the empirical base , confirming or challenging old generalizations and establishing new ones . at the same time , recent theoretical developments in both phonology and syntax lead to important questions concerning the formal and / or substantive nature of universals in language , and the quest for the exact sources of variation between languages . in phonology , universals have typically been assumed to exist in many different subcomponents , e . g . features , prosodic constituents . only in recent years , with the emergence of output-based evaluation systems , has the focus of interest in universals shifted to the study of constraints and their interaction . hence new questions arise : are all constraints universal in the sense that they are constitutive of grammar ? should we conceive of constraints as being exhaustive and ordered ? are there universals that constraint orderings have to obey ? are there different domains ( i . e . lexical and postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are there language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory in the early 80 's assumed principles common to all languages to interact with various types of ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property from which several other properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed to ' micro-parameters ' . now , with the emergence of minimalism and optimality , basic issues like what constitutes a universal principle / constraint , and what constitutes a parameter , need to be re-addressed . is there a universal inventory of functional heads / features ? as to the autonomy of , or the division of labour between syntax and morphology : is parametrized variation confined to inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted to the choice of overt or zero realization of a given feature ? if all movement takes place in a single cycle , does variation reduce to the presence of affixes or the lack thereof ? are there universal constraints in morpho-syntax ? moreover , in recent years it has been argued that thematic relations are features . what are their characteristics ? do these have a universal inventory ? could they be parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' of word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . in this respect , kayne 's proposal for a universal ordering merely shifts the burden from phrase structure to movement . a guiding heuristic of generative grammar has been that parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are to be preferred ; but minimalism goes further in suggesting that economy is built into ug itself . to what extent can the hypothesis that ug principles instantiate notions of economy be upheld ? in studying ug , we take the external systems with which it interfaces to be invariant in linguistically significant senses across individuals and languages . thus we posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( and uniformity across languages at lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , a universal parser , etc . ; so that variation is confined to grammars , in particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp ; aspects of the lexicon . yet properties of external systems may have far-reaching consequences for our view of ug . as we learn more about them , universals attributed to ug may have to be reassigned . what if ug - compatible grammars determine languages that cannot exist because they are unuseable ( unparseable ; unlearnable ; etc ) ? are there universal patterns in the acquisition process , in parsing strategies , etc . , that can be brought to bear ? the colloquium will consist of 20 talks of 45 minutes each plus discussion . abstracts may not exceed 2 pages with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font not smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in tenfold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation to : glow selection committee c / o artemis alexiadou zentrum fr allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , typologie und universalienforschung jgerstr . 10 / 11 , 10117 berlin germany phone : + 49-30 - 20192404 / 1 fax : + 49-30 - 20192402 e-mail : glow99 @ zas . gwz-berlin . de url : http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de / events / glow / index . htm the workshops 1 . sources for universals recent developments in syntax and phonology such as the minimalist program or optimality theory have led to new insights into the structure of the human linguistic capacity . in the context of such theoretical developments , the conviction has grown that recourse to innate properties of language cannot be the only explanation for the existence of certain generalizations of formal linguistic structure . the idea of the workshop "" sources for universals "" is to bring together researchers from various fields inside and outside of syntax and phonology in order to identify possible sources for formal universals of natural language . such possible sources could come from the following domains , semantic universals consideration of processing difficulty considerations of laws of historical development for languages considersations of constraints on language acquisition biological constraints in the sense of a "" universal grammar "" constraints inherent in the computational mechanisms serving language , this list is not meant to be exhaustive . contributions which link formal universals as discussed in recent grammatical models to any of such sources are particularly welcomed . 2 . technical aspects of movement filler - gap dependencies ( fgd ) belong to the most intriguing properties of natural language grammatical theories have to deal with . finding the right approach continues to be a matter of no little controversy . capturing the core properties of fgds , concepts of strictest c-command , which require fillers and their gaps to be immediately attached to the same projection line , arguably possess a high amount of naturalness or simplicity . this type of constraint is directly reflected by linear indexed grammars and has been implemented in the minimalist extension condition on structure building . ( attempts to derive the c-command relation from the minimalist operation merge take this strategy even further . ) yet , head-movement configurations , analyzed as adjunction in the principles and parameters variant of generative grammar , seem to require weaker versions of c-command , such that the adjoined head ' inherits ' the c-command domain of the head adjoined to . it is an open question , whether there are alternatives that do not - one way or the other - employ similar auxiliary devices . as is well known , fgd - patterns ( nested / crossed ) have consequences for the generative power of the grammars describing them . it is not properly understood , however , which devices of which systems capture less orderly patterns best . systems using slash-categories or similar techniques seem to run into considerable difficulty here . feature - lists integrated into a checking theory of movement may be considered one of various alternatives . most recently , the minimalist adoption of the "" copy theory of movement "" opened up another array of related issues . how , for example , do checking resources get eliminated if each step leading to elimination is preceded by a step of copying these resources ? are copies of np / wh - moved constituents assumed to retain properties of empty anaphors and syntactic variables respectively , or has any reference to empty categories ( e . g . ecp ) and their potential link to binding theory become undefined ? if the latter , could this change be motivated by complexity results concerning the powerful device of free indexation , as employed by gb binding theory ? indeed , a general ban on the use of indices has been accompanying the "" copy theory of movement "" . this calls for a demonstration how chains , the standard "" legitimate lf - objects "" , which in alternative versions of syntax are supposed to fully supplant movement , get handled without such devices . primary properties to be defined on chains of copies , for example , would be pf - realizability as well as the distinction between operator , variable , and descriptive content status at lf ( nontrivial consequences for the analyses of qr and acd being directly implied ) . alternatively , it would be helpful to be able to appreciate how far any worked-out proposals deviate from structure-sharing techniques as used in hpsg / lfg ( a . o . ) , index percolation devices from variants of indexed grammar , and other structure generating systems like tree adjoining grammar or categorial grammar . this workshop invites submissions of papers shedding light on the above questions from both technical / formal and linguistic angles . abstracts for both workshops are invited for 45 minute presentations ( plus 15 minutes dicussion ) . they should not exceed one page / 500 words . please send five anonymous copies plus a camera ready original ( with author 's name , address , and affiliation ) to the address specified below . speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses on the scale that applies to the colloquium . glow workshops c / o matthias schlesewsky institut fuer linguistik universitt potsdam postfach 60 15 53 d 14415 potsdam germany phone : x49 - 331-977 - 2016 fax : x49 - 331-977 - 2761 e-mail : glow _ workshop @ ling . uni-potsdam . de url : http : / / www . ling . uni-potsdam . de / ik / glow . html 3 . phonetics in phonology invited speakers : edward flemming , donca steriade organizers : carlos gussenhoven , ren kager the workshop is broadly concerned with the relevance of articulatory and perceptual facts for phonological theory . more specifically , it intends to focus on such questions as the extent to which functional factors determine phonological grammars , the status of the distinction between phonological representation and phonetic implementation , the issue of multiple ( articulation-based as well as perception-based ) phonological representations , and the universality and ` groundedness ' of phonological constraints . the workshop will consist of approximately 7 talks of 45 minutes each , followed by 15 minutes of discussion . abstracts may not exceed one page with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font no smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in threefold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation , to glow phonology workshop c / o . ren kager utrecht institute of linguistics / ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht netherlands phone : + 31-30 - 2538064 fax : + 31-30 - 2536000 deadline for submission of abstracts : december 1 , 1998 submission by fax or e-mail will not be accepted .",Safe Email

As you read on you'll discover how a 'Seen on National TV'
program is paying out excellent returns, every 4 to 5 months
from your home, for a minimal initial startup investment of
only $25 US Dollars. ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE
AND THE INTERNET!This is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money.This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable 
opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time 
I passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what 
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
required.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income 
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.=====================================================================
Here is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for 
a long time but I never believed in it.  But one day when I received 
this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed 
the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money 
started to come in.  First month I only made a small amount of money,  
but the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  
So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made 
a lot more and I am playing it again.  The key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  =====================================================================
More testimonials later but first:*****PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE & FOLLOW THESE
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS TRUE! *****INSTRUCTIONS:
============
**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.**** For each report, send $5 U.S. CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to
the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
  TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  **** When you place your order, make sure
       you order each of the 5 reports ****You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them.YOUR UP-FRONT COST is ONLY $5 X 5 = $25.00.*********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
send to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.
Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk
in case something happens to your computer.**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people
who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the
list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps
1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you change it.Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,
it will NOT work! People have tried to put their friends/relatives
names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it
does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened.So do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in
REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is
no doubt counting their money.2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.
6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
=========================================================Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any
data.To assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,
the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails
legally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much, much more.There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
  =======================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how
it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out
only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing
receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much
better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people
may send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each
for a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and
ordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is
10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)
Emails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report #5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half
million).  Your total income in this example is:
  1..... $50 +
  2..... $500 +
  3..... $5,000 +
  4..... $50,000 +
  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!
-----------------------------------------------------------
  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,
or 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?  There are over 500 million people on the
Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people
may do just that, and more!  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
  ===================================================
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there
are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of
free ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.
We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD
# 2 as you go along.For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails
they send out, with your name and address on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the
report.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Note:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.
Checks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash
is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in
the envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER
and the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,
your NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper
'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your
country.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:

*************************************************
If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within
2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for Report #2.  If you
did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you!THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved
down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report
people are ordering from you.  IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN!!!
  ____________________________________________________  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it
in any way.  It works exceedingly well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you
have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others
to #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will reach.So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,
materials and opportunity .... IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS======================'' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  
I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled 
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the 
whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
percentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later 
she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, 
and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within 
3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days 
she had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I
have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
==============================================================='' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make 
up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that 
I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that 
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my 
medium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large 
6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this 
deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.
Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta,
Canada
================================================================'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later 
I wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no 
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until 
I was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed 
then it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I 
made a six figure income on my first try and all the money came
within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
================================================================'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money 
with little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions 
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My 
first month I made a substantial income and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.
Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet''.

"Hi Thor,[Still trying to catch my breath] :-)I guess there's no easy way to avoid this. In order to proactively
protect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into
their defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and
heuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running
into false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these
some are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.
Consider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft
software without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to
protect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.
malicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason. Looking

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with yesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREEhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...Recommend It!

SQLView v2.1.0.20 [5.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/fredbubbers/software/{View ODBC Output} SQLView is ""A SQL Database viewing utility. (It) automatically detects all available ODBC data sources and displays them in an explorer-like tree. User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV or .XML files."" I didn't really have much on my machine to throw at this program. However, the one data source I did have (mostly related to Music CD creation) displayed perfectly in SQL View.

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
    Unearthed by Shawn Verrallhttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
 
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is.

Â GnomeTIPI am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

"addendum to coston 's object affixes in his summary of object affixes ( linguist list : vol-6 - 235 . fri 17 feb 1995 ) , simon corston observes : languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . that , however , really depends on what we mean by object affixes ( and subject affixes for that matter ) . so - called subject and object affixes fall into three types : ( i ) nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers ; ( ii ) ' functionally ambiguous ' agreement markers ( i . e . functioning as both nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers and anaphoric / referential markers depending on the context ) ( bresnan and mchombo 1987 ) ; and ( iii ) anaphoric or referential markers . the nuclear micronesian group provides an interesting case for the foregoing distinction . for instance , in woleaian , the subject markers are independent words , whereas the object markers are suffixes . but they are both functionally ambiguous agreement markers . in kusaiean , the subject and object markers are also independent words and suffixes , respectively . but they are all referential pronouns . for more detailed discussion of the nuclear micronesian languages see my paper : ' the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages ' ( see refs below ) . if the complexity in subject and object affixes ( viz . the three types mentioned above ) is disregarded , probably corston 's observation may hold . but if only anaphoric / referential subject and object markers are taken into account , it may be a different story . in fact , in the same paper i have used a small convenience sample of 40 languages to ascertain whether the verb - object bonding principle ( as proposed in tomlin 1986 : ' a transitive verb and its object form a more cohesive , unified syntactic and semantic whole than do a transitive verb and its subject ' ) is evident in the pronominal system as well : e . g . object pronouns are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns are . the upshot of this investigation is that object pronouns ( e . g . affixes ) are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns ( e . g . independent words ) . this suggests that insofar as referential / anaphoric markers are concerned , ' languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations ' may be crosslinguistically common , rather than uncommon . refereneces bresnan j . and s . mchombo 1987 . topic , pronoun , and agreement in chichewa . language 63 : 741-782 . givon , t . 1976 . topic , pronoun , and grammatical agreement . in subject and topic , ed . by c . n . li , pp . 149-188 . new york : academic press . tomlin , r . s . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . song , j . j . 1994 . the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages . oceanic linguistics 33 . 2 ( in press ) . jae jung song university of otago new zealand",Safe Email

! ! follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed ! instructions : * * * * order all 3 reports shown on the list below . * * * * for each report , send $ 10 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . * * * * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 3 reports . you will need all 3 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 10 x 3 = $ 30 . 00 . * * * * within a few days you will receive , vie e - mail , each of the 3 reports from these 3 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer . * * * * . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1 through 4 ' ' or you will loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all three thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! 1 . . after you have ordered all 3 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 3 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 3 . . . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 . 4 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately !

remember friend , this is assuming only 20 people ordering out of 10 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 10 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ available reports _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 10 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper . write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : "" the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net "" order report # 1 from : anthony henry 1374 utah street san francisco , ca 94110 usa report # 2 : "" the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net "" get a free bonus report : "" how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net "" order report # 2 and get your free report from : ivan viaz 2119 n meade chicago , il 60639 usa report # 3 : "" the secret to multilevel marketing on the net "" get a free bonus report : "" how to send 1 million e - mails for free "" order report # 3 and get your free report from : renee nunez 4931 w hutchinson st chicago , il 60641 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do not receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . after you have received 20 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 200 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . once you have received 200 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mail sand start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !

"like HP is using the DMCA to prevent full disclosure of security vulnerablities. This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov -----From: Vladimir Katalov Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html?tag=fd_topBy Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PTWASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it ""could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years"" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system.HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books.If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that ""is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection"" of copyrighted works.On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias ""Phased,"" said in the message: ""Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.""That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[...]_______________________________________________ ------------------------ http://www.anti-dmca.org ------------------------DMCA_Discuss mailing list DMCA_Discuss@lists.microshaft.org http://lists.microshaft.org/mailman/listinfo/dmca_discuss----- End forwarded message ----- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.htmlA New Theory on Mapping the New WorldBy Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a

"lx as * science * ? i accept the editors ' recent challenge for resuming last year 's thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 's when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i ' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists ' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it 's * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n't there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where 's our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can't stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic ' attractors ' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein 's relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a "" pseudo-science "" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n't need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : "" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval 's most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be 's cientific ' - - then it had to be ' logical ' "" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , "" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? "" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a 's hamanic stance ' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as ' cause ' and 'd etermine ' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( "" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . "" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word ' karma ' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the ' comes around ' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning 'd irect object of verb ' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" > < - - john lennon >",Safe Email

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria ) who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children , hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband . i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . having noted the confidence reposed on your person , i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general ( my husband ) . this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons . it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf . on your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact , the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband . in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars . in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur ( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal . i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co - operation . in view of all above details , i request you to keep this letter and co - operation highly confidential . best wishes , mrs . mariam abacha .",Phishing Email

"typology we would like to bring to your attention recent publications from john benjamins publishing in the field of typology . the typology and dialectology of romani edited by : yaron matras , peter bakker and hristo kyuchukov university of manchester / aarhus universitet / university of shumen , bulgaria 1997 xxxii , 224 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 156 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 872 8 price : us $ 65 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3661 5 price : nlg 130 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com contributions to this collection focus on the unity and diversity of the language of the roma ( gypsies ) , the only indic language spoken exclusively in europe . properties discussed include the distinct inflectional and derivational patterns applied to asian and european lexical layers , the distribution of inflectional , agglutinative , and analytic formation among syntactic categories , regularities in the ongoing shift from inflectional to analytic case formation , suppletion , aspects of syntactic convergence , and patterns of morphological transitivization and de-transitivization ( causatives and passives ) . these phenomena are considered in the light of contemporary discussions on language universals , with reference to a variety of different approaches including prague school typology , functional sentence perspective , functional grammar , functional-pragmatic typology , and general grammaticalization theory . chapters partly adopt a comparative approach covering all major dialects of the language , and are partly devoted to single-dialect corpuses . special attention is given to the czech / slovak and hungarian varieties , to previously undescribed dialects from bulgaria and turkey , to codified varieties in macedonia , and to the variety of dialects discussed in the popular works of the victorian author george borrow . an extensive introduction outlines the principal morphosyntactic features of the language and provides a classification of romani dialects , including an overview of those mentioned in the volume . contributions by : peter bakker ; norbert boretzky ; vit bubenik ; petra cech ; viktor elsik ; victor a . friedman ; ian f . hancock ; mozes f . heinschink ; milena hubschmannova ; birgit igla ; yaron matras . coding the hypothetical a comparative typology of russian and macedonian conditionals . jane f . hacking the university of kansas 1997 , vi , 156 pp . studies in language companion series , 38 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 849 3 price : us $ 63 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3041 2 price : nlg 125 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com conditionals encode speculation . they convey how events could have been different in the past or present , or might be different in the future if particular conditions had been or will be met . while all languages afford the means to speculate or hypothesize about possible events , the ways in which they do so vary . this work explores some of this variation through an analysis of the structure and semantics of complex conditional sentences in russian and macedonian . it addresses typological questions about the general properties of natural language conditionals and examines the role of the grammatical categories tense , aspect , mood and status in the coding of conditional meaning . the book also discusses the relationship between the use of these categories and the shape of a language 's conditional system . for example , the use of tense in counterfactual contexts in macedonian correlates with the grammaticalization of more shades of conditional meaning than are grammaticalized in russian , which does not employ tense forms in this way . the book addresses issues of concern to slavists and raises questions for those interested in conditionals and the coding of hypothetical meaning . case , typology and grammar . in honor of barry j . blake edited by anna siewierska and jae jung song lancaster university / university of otago 1998 395 pp . typological studies in language , 38 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 651 2 price : us $ 85 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 2937 6 price : nlg 170 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this collection of fifteen original articles includes descriptive , typological and / or theoretical studies of a number of morphosyntactic phenomena , such as case , transitivity , grammaticalization , valency alternations , etc . , in a variety of languages or language groups , and discussions concerning theoretical issues in specific grammatical frameworks . the collection , written in honor of the australian linguist , barry j . blake on his 60th birthday , thematically reflects the field that professor blake has worked in over the past three decades . the volume will be of special interest to researchers in morphosyntax and linguistic typology . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com",Safe Email

no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.-- Seeya,
Paul

"Hi,Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality. 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.Putting	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.

"HELP.
I had GPG working.
I updated from version gnupg-1.0.6 to gnupg-1.0.7.
This moved gpg from /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin and I changed the path
in the exmh 'executable'.With that fix, EXMH knows I have GPG, and puts the line	Check the signature with GnuPGin messages with GnuPG signatures.  But punching the line ALWAYS

"" no hits to the p & l , zero tolerance for incompetency and complacency . you can not do what you need to do globally without the trust and confidence in his performance additionally he must identify and develop his successor . get a covenant from brent that his is fully committed to do the work also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully in this effort as long as he does his part and keeps you informed . call me if needed . tom - sally beck notes for brent price august 2000 . doc",Safe Email

settings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like
all good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity
configurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have
reasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings
altogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so
many are).As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that
gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?Cheers,
Dave.--

"> Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, ...Careful now, you're talking about
most (80%) of the country.(although perhaps it is true that in
a democracy, the people wind up with
the government which they deserve)> ... I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US ...... and there is a large excluded middle
between those ""in poverty"" and those who
are more affluent than ""working class"".I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far.  At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,
the percentages break down as follows:work\pov.  yes  no
yes        9    72
no        11     8-Dave:::::::::::* perhaps that's not even enough:
""[Irvine] ""Everyone has to take a job sometime"" / NH3""
(1998 wealth data was supposedly released
in 2001, but I haven't seen it yet on the
census site.  Anyone have a pointer?):::::::::::> Do you punish the whole industry due to a few bad apples?>>From what little I have heard, the
legislation simply says that lying
in one's public figures is not just
a matter of cheating the accounts,
but really involves stealing time
and money from one's employees and
investors.  How does not tolerating
the bad apples equate to punishing
the good ones?

I don't think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help
against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter.  That's WAY
outside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when
ballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead
associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard
problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge
is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials
performance requirements to places they've never been; there has been
some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes
they've had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms,
while way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector
(and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old
MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to
help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile
intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the
technologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a
technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to
believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of
ballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without
reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly
convincing nor conclusive.In summary:1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You
are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big
nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). 2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more
competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination
capabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they've
had twenty years to work on it.3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying
ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of
the R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it
one way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits
over it either.Cheers,-James Rogers

"sum : x - rays and acoustic signals dear linguist members , some weeks ago i published a request for information about methods of measuring movements of the articulating organs . within this field i was especially interested in x - ray documentation and films . alice faber ( faber @ haskins . yale . edu ) wrote that "" back in the 1960 's the center for applied linguistics here in the us made a set of such films of ' exotic ' languages . we have a set here at haskins , . . . "" caroline smith reported on another method of measurement . she wrote that a method of measurement which works on the basis of electromagnetism was used by "" the people at the institut fuer phonetik und sprachliche kommunikation der universitaet muenchen , who are the world leaders in electromagneticarticulography ( fipkm @ phonetik . uni-muenchen . de ) . "" bob port ( port @ cs . indiana . edu ) from indiana reports on "" x - ray microbeam data at univ of wisconsin . "" and continues "" there is now a large amount of material available , but is not in video form "" a most interesting hint at x - ray documentation i want to give verbally at this place : kenneth r . beesley ( ken . beesley @ xerox . fr ) writes : "" i have also seen x - ray movies from the eastman collection in rochester , new york . these films show , among many other things , people talking , playing musical instruments , and moving in various ways . for medical interest , there are also films of swallowing and bladder functions . i have seen some x - ray photographs of vowel-production settings from the old ussr , but these are less interesting than films . the eastman films , produced in the 1940s and early 50s , i believe , are unintentionally frightening because the doses of x - rays considered safe then were perhaps 500 times what they are now . as best i can remember , these films were somewhat inspired by x - ray films made by the nazis using inmates of concentration camps . these films , brought back to the united states after the war , were watched in fascination by eastman and his colleagues . they featured scenes with full skeletons walking about . the x - ray doses were no doubt fatal to the victims . "" beesley also reports on phoneticians from the university of glasgow , scotland and members of the school of dentistry , who some eighteen years ago produced x - ray images that show people talking . helmer strike ( strik @ let . kun . nl ) delivers two methods of measuring articulation : "" the technique that resembles the old x - ray films the most is called mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . a good article on this topic is baer et al . ( 1991 ) journal of the acoustical society of america , nr . 90 ( 2 ) , pp . 799 - 828 . . . . another , quite different technique , which is used very often , is called epg ( electro - palato - graphy ) "" in particular , i would like to thank ocke bohn ( gen01 . @ rz . uni-kiel . d400 . de ) for having sent me an article on how to describe articulation by means of infrared light . she reported as well on experiments using ultrasound for recording the movements of the articulating organs . in conclusion , i want to give another idea of how to make use of cd-rom in combination with x - ray technology . today 's technology has made it possible to save pictures and videos ( here videos produced through x - rays ) conveniently down onto a cd . this opens up the possibility to combine recordings of various institutions on one cd and , by means of this collection , deliver an outstanding contribution to the further understanding of what is happening when people talk . besides the actual recordings , further information about videos and x - ray images that concerns both the history of this subject and its methodology could be gathered in one single multi media application in such a way that a cd like this would provide important information about the topic "" articulation and the methods of its measurement "" in a user-friendly way and , what is more , would be available for a greater number of non-expert pc - users . anyone interested in this project and willing to support this idea should write to one of the following addresses : e - mail : fran2801 @ pcmail . uni-trier . de home : ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany",Safe Email

This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?Thanks,

> Do you feel capable of writing such a tool?  It doesn't look too hard.Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package
did.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing the
data somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spamYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's
done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to
train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients.  That's the ""delete as spam"" button
Paul Graham was talking about.* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the
  opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  ""eggs"".Neale

"Gary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /",Safe Email

"re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations i agree with mark durie that it is less curious that chomsky is cited so much than that others before him are cited so little , at least by linguists . for example , two of the most important issues in multilinear phonology , one fairly recent , the other around since the 70 's , are many-to - one mapping between tones and vowels and * prosodic licensing * , the notion that elements of one linguistic level must belong to units of a higher level ( usually the next level up ) . both of these notions are explicit principles of tagmemic phonology ( on the first cf . the last two paragraphs of pike & pike 1947 , then read the first line of the introduction to goldsmith 's 1976 phd thesis for an interesting contrast ; on the second principle , cf . pike 1967 and his discussion of the ` phonemic hierarchy ' ) . one rarely sees pike quoted in this regard ( e . selkirk has long been an exception to this pattern , though ) . geoff pullum 's nllt column on citation etiquette in linguistics takes up this general problem . this is partially understandable since a lot of tagmemics ' insights take the unappealing form of a disjoint set of ad-hoc commentaries on the last language pike looked at . nevertheless , there is no way to deny that pike is responsible for some brilliant insights into human language . and pike is just one example . there are plenty of others . it is not that anyone needs chomsky to make their work respectable . that is clearly false , whether the individual is saussure or a student . still , if anyone were to seriously doubt that it is chomsky , not saussure , nor bloomfield , nor sapir , nor even jakobson , who ` put linguistics on the map ' of the intellectual disciplines and who has done more to keep it there than anyone else is in need of some psychiatric help . moreover , the fact that chomsky publishes more than any other linguist ( if i am wrong , please correct me - that would be interesting ) does n't hurt his citation index . his output is nearly asimovian . his influence on the field can be seen even at the level of university administration : when a department chairperson wants to convince a university administrator that linguistics has natural intellectual ties to many departments , i do not think that they would drop the names of saussure or pike rather than chomsky . it is worth considering the possibility that many of the citations of chomsky 's work could be due to ignorance - if he said it , or even if we think he did , just cite him and nobody will argue ; why look for the * original * source ? that 's hard work and laziness too often prevails . but it is also true that , like it or not , the source of many of the most interesting ideas in history on human language came from 20d-219 , mit .",Safe Email

In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true,
compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary
for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you
just might get away with it!)However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must 
provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might
buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell
that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide
the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just
might make money at this, since there might be a market of
10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of
getting a binary.But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for
1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite
/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of
the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost
(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any
business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_
charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be
providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of
business faster than a dot-com in 2001.And there are real ways to provide this value for money
(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a
friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,
convenience of having what lots of other people have,
posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading
over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from
a ""real"" company, etc).There will be segments of the market that will pay various
amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't.
Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the
source will always be free (or minimal cost).Later,

run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.Matthias> On Sat, Jun 08, 2002 at 11:39:03PM +0200, Axel Thimm wrote:

"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620Close encounter of burnt kindIT came from outer space Â­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation Â­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed Â­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to
use quickly, but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in,
there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
member of a group, but you cannot delete the group.Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from
your current settings.All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans
for another run.--

many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with

"gene flow and indo - europeans h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( "" pre - "" , "" proto - "" , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that "" [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . "" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts",Safe Email
"**Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom: daev Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________ Rev.

Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00

"Two interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as
best I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in
2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest
are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of
speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in
the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more
draconian than the DMCA.http://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002There are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about
copyright and the like in Ireland.Cheers,

Kragen, do you know of any?I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.So where's all that booze? When's the retry?
Every robust protocol needs a retry strategy --
what's yours?- Joe the Angry DwarfP.S. Ain't no dwarf.

"syllable structure and gesture timing call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is "" are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable "" ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .",Safe Email

"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",Phishing Email

( 1 ) ( a : * ; b : ok ; c : ? ) ( context : my employer is so puritanical that he would fire me if i behaved in what he considered a libertine manner . ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , he would fire me , but , since she would n't ever smoke , he won't fire me . comment of a : the ' even if ' clause is ok with with "" he . . . me "" , but the second halfdoesn ' t match . no one would ever phrase this combination of ideas this way . it has a split focus . is the topic the extent of the employer 's puritanism ( first half ) , or the likelihood / unlikelihood of the speaker 's being fired ( second half ) . i find even my japanese colleagues do this split focus thing all the time . such sentences are extremely difficult and often impossible to parse in any natural way . it took several years of familiarity with japanese versions of english for me even to identify what is going on in sentences like this . i 'd love to know an effective way to explain to japanese students of english why this won't work and maybe more important , how to recognize that they ' ve pro9duced an illicit split focus construction . ( 2 ) ( a : ? ? ? ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but , since you sruely won't drink at all , he won't fire you . comment of a : a ) "" "" even if . . . will fire you "" is most easily interpreted as habitual , while "" you surely * won't * drink at all "" would designate a single event in the future . these sit uneasily together . b ) since drinking a lot is antithetical to drinking a little , the last clause must imply that the boss is thinking of firing the addressee for some other reason . in this case , interpeting the first half according to a ) above , there can be no connection between the firing and the drinking and the sentence fails by virtue of non-entailment . on the other hand , if one * goes back * and reinterprets the ' you ' in the first half merely as the addressee , then the sentence might be possible , given that condition b ) abvove represents the real state of affairs . it would also be implied that the boss needs just a little bit more reason to actualy execute the firing . the final clause would sound better with "" can't "" than with "" won't "" , however , in this scenario . ( 3 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you . comment of a : the action posited by the "" even if "" clause is already a maximum limit . the sentence is logically impossible . comment of b : but if you continue the sentence as below then it is fine by me . ( 3 ) ( ok ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you , you ' ll get fed up and quit before he gets a chance . ( 4 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) if it doesn ' rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will continue ; but if it rains heavily , the rain will be cancelled . i ' m sorry i ' ve made a mistake here . the final clause should be , the game will be cancelled , as roecklein ( a ) pointed out . ( 5 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue . comment of a : nonsense , in order and logic . comment of b : okay if you continue with something like : ( 5 ) ( ok ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue . "" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue , but it will be moved to an indoor arena . ( 6 ) ( a : * * ; b : ? ; c : * ) "" even if "" the president were to get ingestion tonight , the cease-fire would end , but , if we resume negotiations with the enemy for a treaty of peace , it will continue . i ' m sorry i ' ve mistyped the word here too . ingestion should be indigestion . comment of a : i would imagine rather that indigestion would contribute to the end of the ceasefire . ( 7 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , i would not scold her , but , if she ever broke my favorite dishes , i would scold her . comment of a : "" scold her "" should nto be repeated at the end . very unnatural . ( 8 ) ( a : ? ; b : ? ; c : ? ) "" even if "" my wife smokes cigarettes , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of a : underlying logic ok . i do n't like "" even if "" with the indicative present verb because i like to mark conditionals on the verb , but i ' m aware that this usage is in process of change . same proviso as above for the repeated "" scold her . "" the preferences of conditionals in even if clause over the indicative present are the same to all three people . however , i found many examples of the indicative type . this seems a matter of individual preferences . comment of b : ( 8 ) ( ok ) "" even if "" my wife smokes cigarettes at the dinner table , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of c : to make sense of many of your contexts , i had to postpose the "" even if "" clause , e . g . , "" i will not scold my wife , even if she smokes cigarettes . "" placing the "" even if "" clause first in the sentence makes it more emphatic . my own summary : ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are judged logically impossible as i have expected . but i do not understand laura gonnerman 's rephrasing ok sentence of ( 5 ) . ( 6 ) is also judged unnnatural to all the three people though i expected it would be ok . it seems to me the final clause cahnges the situation and focus of the sentence . why not ok ? finally , i must apologize to you all about the use of "" scold "" in the final two sentences . one person reminded me of the bad implication of husband 's scolding his wife . i did n't notice it . in japan , too , a husband who "" scold "" his wife is an arrogant person these days . thank you very much for your help . please make further comments , if any , on this usage . i ' ll be glad to make a reply . hiroaki tanaka associate professor faculty of integrated arts and sciences tokushima university , japan 1 - 1 , minamijousanjioma , tokushima , 770 , japan phone & fax : + 81 886 56 7125 e-mail : hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp",Safe Email

in all the discussions about RSS 2.0, and I like him, and would like to work 
with him in the future. I don't say that lightly. This evening he posted a note
[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside 
RSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm 
me. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things 
""RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news 
feeds. That's all it is for, for the 18,000th time."" It's time for RDF to pack 
its bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once 
and for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS 
alone. Thank you.[1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002330.php

"chechen who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term "" chechen "" is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ; "" chechnya "" is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , "" ingush "" is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name ; the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) ; in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians ; to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european ; to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus ; and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 ; known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks ; hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages ; and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) ; verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication ; any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer ; there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though "" rehabilitated "" in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights ; since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there ; there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .

"commoditylogic . com mike , further to our conversation , here are some of the things i thought of while speaking with tom gros . there are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the hub idea within commoditylogic . com as successful as enrononline rather than have it turn out like sitara . i won ' t repeat thoughts about how we split cl from enron , but let ' s put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution . well , that ' s an easy decision , somebody else is doing the hard work , and not charging us very much for it . so sign - up , but don ' t rely on anything until we see everything working . handling counterparties not using the system the challenge here is that the final solution world with overybody using the hub is wonderful , but until everybody is using the hub , we have to keep other procedures and systems going , which stretches resources , development , it support and user . this was why we decided to delay getting bolero - the concept is wonderful , but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system . this is classic chicken and egg . tom has a vision of cl providing the staff to handle this . this is taking us closer to an outsource - to - andersen - consulting model which is certainly achievable , although not quite such an easy sell . how much resource is left the latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people , who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards . how about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to cl , and then review what is left in the remaining environment . does it mean we hold off doing anything ? if we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people ! we should go through costing for "" what happens if we completely stop development of x project ? "" . if that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing , but i hope in most cases it is not ! start small to prove concept e . g . first application in april 2001 only covers 20 fields this is excellent , and we needn ' t shout it too loud to investors in cl , but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systems . we might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 years out ? include european aspects from the beginning this really isn ' t very difficult so long as one has some long - on - common - sense europeans ( not just brits ) involved in both specification and development from the beginning , but an as example of how not to do it , look at enpower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc ! 80 - 20 rule for types of transaction eol has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first . once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting ( dtl ) and risk ( risktrac ? ) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on stp , and yet - to - become - vanilla products on explicitly different , manual approaches . until that time , we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system , which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly ( think of certain deals in power 99 which are approximations of the actual deals , and manually tweaked every so often ) testing tom ' s first thought is that we could leverage initial users ( who would not pay ) to do much of the testing . eol clearly got its testing done , but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases - component , system , integration , end - to - end , and then user - acceptance . eol saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process . it did have massive resource - commandability and so obtained input from many traders . do the support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention ? given how often i hear "" short people "" , that strikes me as something which in london would require significant additional resource , even after mg is absorbed . what else did you come up with ? richard",Safe Email

"" he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities . still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on : what the state receives in return for the bailout the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday ) additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may . there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend . additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund . 2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants . no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer . 3 . long - term contracts as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years . assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "" tablet from on high "" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 . these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line . according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary . 4 . air quality district exemptions there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government . currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow "" dirtier "" plants to come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) . 5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout . 6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable . 7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash . ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .",Safe Email

"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot

Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had no problems with great performance.Robert Harley worte: >Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows. >They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a >service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to >run C programs.Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad"" programming language or application platform? You don't think this has anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you? Or that MS has basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#? Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the right way to go for most high level applications?Reza B'Far wrote: >2.

You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak? I am not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close...

Robert Harley wrote: >If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve, >then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.Wow! So you're telling me that unless the application involves bit-counting, it's trivial? What about the application itself? What about high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.? Aren't most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns? Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code? For example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?>I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low >level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over >and over again... Robert Harley wrote: >You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time >on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends >entirely on the programmer, not the language.I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers. In those cases, it's always very hard to get the programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc. With Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database (JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS). >3. Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform... Robert Harley wrote: >Buzzword.YIKES! Have you written db code with C/C++ for different databases (just an example)? Tried porting a persistence layer from Windows to Unix?

Robert Harley wrote: >Unsupported assertion.So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff). Is there a standard way of dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging, database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java? I'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim ignorance...Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every ""Kid"" can write a well designed Java program. Kids typically don't understand various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++ than in Java due to existence of standard API's.",Safe Email

Here is what you do.Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards. Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo... essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.Turn on the system. If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about lack of video card then.Switch it off. Remove it's ram.Same procedure as above.If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink & fan).If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes, from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.

50 TIPS TO MAKE WINDOWS MORE USEFUL 
Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis? Might as well 
maximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips 
will apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing 
isn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this 
GnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. 
Download Windows Productivity Tips now!  I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK

shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors
http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/
We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513
Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.Â GnomeALERTZ

Test Drive Compaq Servers
http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/
Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an 
Alpha server, but without the hassle and expense of 
obtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-
configured environment that lets you kick the tires without 
causing any permanent damage.

Too Cool
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp
This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled 
systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

""The marine biologists and geologists believe they have shown life could have existed by processing methane without the presence of oxygen. ""Their findings could also prove useful in ridding the earth of excess methane, one of the greenhouse gases many scientists believe is responsible for global warming. ""Traditional views of early life on earth centre on plants which converted carbon dioxide to oxygen. ""'These (plant lifeforms) date back to between three and 3.5 billion years ago... We have found biomass (large cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show could have existed around four billion years ago,' Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told Reuters.Link: Yes, she exists. Dr. Antje does more than exist. She gives some kinda publicity shot. Dang! http://www.mpi-bremen.de/deutsch/biogeo/aboetius/aboetius.html http://www.iu-bremen.de/directory/faculty/01063/ ""The two-year research by the scientists from Hamburg University, the Alfred Wegener Institute in northern Bremerhaven and the Max Planck Society centred on coral-forming micro-organisms in the Black Sea at depths where no oxygen and no light is present. ""The Black Sea contains the largest oxygen-free basin in the world. ""The lifeforms were able to process methane together with sulphates within the water, producing carbonates, in the form of coral, as waste. (((Black, oxygen-free ""coral"". I wonder what that stuff looks like. Maybe you could make jewelry out of it.))) ""That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests they may have been around before plant life. ""'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the Black Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth during a long period of the earth's history,' said Boetius. (((Yeah, they've just been sitting down there, waiting to save our bacon.))) ""She believes the findings could prove useful for climate control. ""Previously, scientists had thought that methane, found in abundance in the sea and produced through agriculture, could only be broken down with oxygen. ""The German researchers believe the discovery of a pool of organisms that process methane without oxygen could lead to a way of cutting down potentially harmful greenhouse gases without burning oxygen and producing similarly damaging carbon dioxide.

XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.Some notes from other places....>>From Doom9 [3]
""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
been resolved XviD development will not continue.That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
and kept quiet about the matter at hand.[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
might be hearing more about this.[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
compatible as it was advertised.[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
copyright notices which is quite funny.""[1] http://www.xvid.org/

"re : banning of german while flipping through random books at the linguistics library , i fell over something that would be interesting to this discussion . i have n't been following this thread , so this might have been mentioned before . i found a reference to the us supreme court reports , 1922 october term , meyer vs . nebraska , p . 392 - - 403 in steinberg ( 1993 ) an introduction to psycholinguistics , longman . i ' ll quote the passage in full , as it is so well written . it 's in the beginning of chapter 8 . "" in may of 1920 , in hamilton county , nebraska , a rural area of the united states , a teacher , mr robert meyer , was arrested for violating state law . mayer had been teaching bible stories in german at zion parochial school to a 10 - year-old boy . nebraska law forbade the teaching of a second language to children under the age of 13 . not only nebraska but 21 other states as well prohibited the teaching of foreign languages , except 'd ead ' languages such as latin and greek . according to nebraska 's 1919 siman act , ' no person . . . shall teach any subject to any person in any language other than the english language . languages other than english may be taught only after a pupil shall have . . . passed the eighth grade . . . . any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction , shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ( $ 25 ) , nor more than one hundred dollars ( $ 100 ) or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense . ' if found guilty , meyer could have been fined or even sent to jail . the states had passed these laws essentially with the german language as the target , america had just finished a war with germany and there was a hatred of germany and things german , particularly its military values , ideals and political institutions . the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . meyer decided to appeal his case to the supreme court of the state of nebraska . ironically , lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position presented in the german language by the german philosopher , wilhelm von humboldt , in 1836 . that is , a language by its very nature represents the spirit and national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could indeed have been harming american children by making them into german militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . the nebraska supreme court denied meyer 's appeal , but meyer did not submit . he then took his case to the highest court in the country , the united states supreme court , where he won his case . that court overturned his conviction and declared unconstitutional all laws in the united states which forbade the teaching of a foreign language . in its 1922 ruling the court stated as one basis for its decision . ' mere knowledge of the german language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful . ' we see in this story that a seemingly purely theoretical issue can have very practical consequences in everyday life . in making a legal decision on the matter , the court also made a psycholinguistic decision , on the relationship of language , thought and culture . was the court correct ? it is this question that we shall now consider .

"re : 6 . 100 sum : ipa history & haceks , stemberger suggests that north american linguists who use haceks are following a tradition which is just as international as that of the international phonetic association , which he labels a western european organization . even a cursory glance at the ipa membership list would have shown him that the ipa is an international body , with many north american members . it is governed by an elected council , with over half the members coming from outside western europe , several of the council being from the united states , others from eastern europe ( poland and russia ) , and others from china , japan , australia , finland , south africa , and nigeria . it is the north american linguists who use diverse symbols who are not following truly international conventions . having said that , let me say that i happen to agree with him that it would be appropriate to use haceks for palato-alveolar sounds . the hacek would then be a diacritic marking a natural class of sounds . i proposed this at the 1989 kiel convention of the ipa , but i was voted down by my more conservative colleagues , who consider it important to keep the ipa as stable as possible . i see their point of view , but prefer mine . nevertheless there is no point in having democratically approved international standards unless one keeps to them , so i will reluctantly avoid haceks . peter ladefoged",Safe Email

1) ""Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out

2) ""This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and
they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can
call.""
The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the
phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has
the patience to ask.The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever
asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company)
and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge.Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I
synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into
usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem
like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful
knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales.	JTShttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as

"discount rates and risk capital dear vince : i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of that addresses these issues . very briefly , 1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate . 2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s opportunity cost of capital . 3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify some of the issues that i have raised . please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this . please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you . regards , sheridan - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu",Safe Email

( otc - bb : dcpi ) dcpi has developed a revolutionary digital printing technology recognized to be the solution to variable graphical / color printing processes by industry leaders such as ibm ( nyse : ibm ) ; xerox ( nyse : xrx ) and siemens ( nyse : si ) whose products only print in black via laser products . dcpi ' s commercial printing application hardware / software and printing consumable products are expected to dominate the printing enhancement market ( $ 5 billion plus + + in 2002 ) over the next several years . dcpi ' s initial target market of more than 4 , 000 large scale commercial printing companies of the total of 46 , 000 establishments is expected to drive revenue growth to the tens of millions within its first few years , further providing an ongoing revenue stream from the sales of printing consumable products for years to come . special investment alert digital color print , inc .

( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially competing technology . printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry ; employing more than 1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry , during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5 billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags , advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500 pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in black . lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation , and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers , price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an lis provided system . lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel during the next two years . dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation . this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the next five trading days ! the writers , pr firm , mailers involved in the creation , and distribution of the information above are not a registered broker / dealer and may not sell , offer to sell or offer to buy any security . this profile is not a solicitation or recommendation to buy , sell securities . an offer to buy or sell can be made only with accompanying disclosure documents from the company offering or selling securities and only in the states and provinces for which they are approved . the material in this release is intended to be strictly informational and based on assumptions rather than fact . the companies that are discussed in this release have not approved the statements made in this release nor approved the timing of this release . all statements and expressions are the sole opinion of the creators and are subject to change without notice . information in this release is derived from a variety of sources including that company ' s publicly disseminated information , third parties and the writers research and optimistic speculation . the accuracy or completeness of the information is not warranted and is only as reliable as the sources from which it was obtained . all involved in the creation and distribution of this profile / release disclaims any and all liability as to the completeness or accuracy of the information contained and any omissions of material fact in this release . the release may contain technical and factual inaccuracies or typographical errors . it is strongly recommended that any purchase or sale decision be discussed with a financial adviser , or a broker -

Date: Not suppliedDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10

"re : trading track information tom wilbeck @ enron 01 / 19 / 2001 03 : 23 pm to : jeffrey c gossett / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : trading track information as you know , we are working on an on - boarding process to get the trading track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their respective rotations . one of the methods of doing this is to have each rotational supervisor ( you ' re one of them ) put a few points together to present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you ( or someone in your group ) . for example : what does you group do as a whole ? the risk management group is responsible for providing information to the trading floor . that information consists of positions , p & l , and other general information which may be needed by the floor throughout the day . the information must be 100 % accurate 100 % of the time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are given . in addition , all reports go to sr . management such as john lavorato and dave delaney . the participants need to know several logistics type things such as : where to sit user tips on the use of related business hardware ( i . e . phone system , intercom , etc . ) how long / when or if to take lunch : use your discretion . expected working hours : expect to be in the office no later than 8 : 00 and preferably by 7 : 30 it is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the participants on their first day : able to work under pressure - you will be asked to provide reports and answers to questions on the floor quickly . you will be expected to know and understand the information that you are giving . ability to handle multiple priorities - there will be times when you are faced with several tasks at once . you will be expected to make quick decisions and understand which is the most important . meets deadlines - everyday in risk you have to meet a deadline . the traders must have positions and p & l on their desks when they walk in in the morning . excellent written communication - your written communication will be in the numbers that you provide to the floor . excellent oral communication - again , the traders will expect answers and expect them quickly . you will need to articulate those in a fashion that is understandable . effective interpersonal skills - see above . attention to detail - this is one of the most important considerations of the job . again , all information must be 100 % accurate , errors are not acceptable . team player - you will be expected to work across all groups upstream and downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems . excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the job , therefore you will need to be organized at all times . is a motivated worker - self explainatory excellent analytical skills - same maintains relationships with traders - the trader will be relying on the information that you provide him . therefore it is important that he trusts what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more or better information . effective time management - self explainatory competent in excel - alot of the work we do is in excel . it is important that you be able to navigate excel , as well as create efficiencies to make the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly . competent with erms - erms is the system that is used to maintain positions and p & l . all deals flow through this system and all values related to deals come from this system . competent with risktrac - risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty risk and value at risk . i expect you to understand what each means , what the limits are , and how you can reduce and add to value at risk . demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - work with the traders to understand why they are putting on the positions that they have . try to understand proper hedging strategies etc . each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations while in your area . also , the participants need to fully understand exactly what they ' ll be doing in your area . let ' em know with as much detail as possible . finally , do you consider any information a pre - requisite for participation in your area ? ( i . e . advanced excel skills . . . etc ) i ' d like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training before coming to your group . advanced excel skills , preferably a level of understanding of positions and value at risk . please compile this information and forward it to me so i can put it into some on - boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of rotations . the first candidates will begin on february 1 , 2001 . thank you very much for you time and consideration . tom wilbeck x 57536",Safe Email

"re : pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion . the main task is to build a pricing system for many names . this has two components - - - 1 ) how to price a single name ? 1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ? 1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ? 2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ? the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is a ) define a small set of liquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has mentioned below , to these names c ) include market prices , if any , for these names d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c ) e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f ) quantify these attributes , if possible g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 . 2 may be a ) define a small set of illiquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f ) define a master set of liquid names g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard , so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am to : ect london credit trading cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development : fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be : establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating / score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' . regards ben",Safe Email

there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,

"sum : words that are their own opposites , pt . 1 in november , i posted a query about what i referred to as "" auto-antonymy "" , the semantic state of a word being its own opposite , either changing its meaning through time or having two opposite meanings at the same time . an example of the former is "" resent "" which used to mean "" appreciate "" as in the following quotations taken from the oxford english dictionary : 1702 c . mather magn . chr . iii . i . iii . ( 1852 ) 309 if she gratefully resented that small thing for the sake of the hand it came from . 1765 warburton in w . & hurd lett . ( 1809 ) 360 , i was sure that this instance of his friendship to you would ever be warmly resented by you . 1829 webster lett . ( 1902 ) 617 , i shall resent through life ( to use an expression of boyle 's ) your unwearied and affecting kindness to me . a word that has two opposite meanings simultaneously is "" fast "" , which means steady , not moving , and at high speed . i asked what the proper term for this phenomenon is , and made a call for other examples of this phenomenon in english and other languages . additionally , i asked whether this a phenomenon that can be rightfully classed with other regular forms of polysemy ( metonymy , metaphor ) and language change , or is it always a curious accident . thanks to the kind responses of linguists around the world , i now know six established names for "" auto-antonymy "" , i have a collection of many interesting examples , and i have been apprised of a dual phenomenon : synonyms that look like antonyms . these linguistic riches will be shared in the following screens . first , the terminology . dirk geeraerts writes that the phenomenon "" is known in the older tradition of historical semantics as ( antiphrasis ) or < enantiosemy > "" . miriam shlesinger and m . lynne murphy noted that such words are sometimes called ( janus words ) , after the two-faced greek mythic figure . larry horn , renowned historian of negation , said the phenomenon had been dubbed ( antilogy ) by john train in his 1980 book "" remarkable words with astonishing origins . david gamon offered the term ( enantiodromia ) for : the diachronic process of acquiring an ' opposite ' meaning , and i suppose a : word having two such meanings would be an ( enantiodrome ) . i learned this , : by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . bob fradkin noted that arabic has a word ( didh ) ( plural < addhaadh > ) for "" a whole category of words that mean ' itself and its opposite . ' "" frankly , i think that all of these terms - - antiphrasis , enantiosemy , janus word , antilogy , enantiodromia ( not to mention didh ) - - are quite opaque to the modern english ear , and the word i coined , "" auto-antonym "" just says it all , and that 's the term i ' ll use for the remainder of this post . now that i ' ve whetted your appetite for some auto-antonymy , here are the examples i received : the top entry , submitted by practically everybody , is the classic example ( cleave ) which means to bring together as well as to cut apart . < splice > and ( clip ) , mentioned less often , operate the same way . another popular word was ( sanction ) , which as a noun means a punitive action and as a verb means to endorse . ( let ) is similar , also meaning to allow , but formerly meaning to prevent . the latter meaning survives in the idioms "" without let or hindrance "" and in "" a let ball "" . kevin rottet notes a similar phenomenon in french , with the word ( defendre ) meaning ' to defend ' and ' to prohibit ' . many mentioned "" overlook "" or "" oversight "" which can mean to look at something carefully as well as to miss something . jane edwards notes that german translation ( versehen ) has the same properties . speaking of german , bernd moebius writes : in german , ' kontrahent ' today means ' opponent ' ( e . g . , often used in sports ) [ . . . . ] there is , however , the rather uncommon use of ' kontrahent ' for two parties sharing a contract , like the english ' contractor ' . karen baumer wins the prize for sending in the most entries . these had been collected by her colleagues at the apple newton project . i give you a selection of the ones not mentioned previously : ) > > aught = all , nothing ) > > bill = invoice , money ) > > comprise = contain , compose ) > > custom = usual , special ) > > dust = to remove , add fine particles ) > > literally = actually , figuratively ) > > model = archetype , copy ) > > moot = debatable , academic ) > > note = promise to pay , money ) > > peer = noble , person of equal rank ) > > put = lay , throw ) > > puzzle = pose problem , solve problem ) > > quantum = very small , very large ( quantum leap ) ) > > ravel = entangle , disentangle ) > > resign = to quit , to sign up again ) > > sanguine = murderous , optimistic ) > > scan = to examine closely , to glance at quickly ) > > set = fix , flow ) > > skin = to cover with , remove outer covering ) > > strike = miss ( baseball ) , hit ) > > table = propose [ british ] , set aside ) > > temper = calmness , passion ) > > trim = cut things off , put things on ) > > a very short list of homophones : ) > > aural , oral = heard , spoken ) > > raise , raze = erect , tear down ) > > ) > > a pair of french words which can be very confusing : ) > > la symetrie ( symmetry ) and l ' asymetrie ( asymmetry ) . ) > > ) > > latin : ) > > immo = yes , no baumer also notes : an example that comes to mind is the word ' prove , ' whose older meaning ' to test ' has been pretty much lost , giving rise to an apparent paradox in the expression "" the exception proves the rule . "" there were quite a few examples from shakespeare . julie vonwiller explains , ( presently ) in shakespeare meant ' immediately ' whereas now it means ' not immediately but i ' ll get round to it ' . roger hurwitz reminds us of shakespeare 's ( nunnery ) , which , in the phrase "" get thee to a nunnery "" referred not to a place of piety , but a house of ill repute . sue blackwell , pointed me to "" as you like it "" , wherein jacques de boys complains : "" rumination wraps me in a most ( humourous ) sadness . "" not at all funny . blackwell adds that ( silly ) used to mean "" blessed "" . here are some examples in other languages that have no parallels in english : an example from dutch : "" ettelijk "" . most native speakers ( everybody ) thinks it means "" many , much "" , but the authoritative dictionary ( van dale ) says it means "" ( a ) little , ( a ) few "" . or at least that is what the dictionary said 10 or 15 years ago ( and our professor of dutch used to "" catch "" us on this one ) . now for the sake of this message i went to look again in a new version of van dale and it says both ! see the evolution ? - - patricia haegeman a swedish example is the verb "" maximera "" ( ' maximize ' ) . the traditional meaning is 's et an upper limit to ' , but now it is also being used in the sense ' make as large as possible ' , probably due to english influence . - - mats eeg-olofsson there 's a strange case in the sahidic dialect of coptic : "" ehrai "" means both "" upwards "" and "" downwards "" . the former derives from egyptian h . ry "" upper part "" ( in which h . represents a pharyngial fricative ) , the latter derives from egyptian h _ ry "" lower part "" ( in which h _ was probably a palatal fricative ) . the distinction between h . and h _ was lost in coptic . - - lance eccles , maquarie university , australia i think that 's enough for now . in a future posting i will summarize the linguistic wisdom on the regularity of the phenomenon . - - alex eulenberg ( aeulenbe @ indiana . edu ) - - indiana university",Safe Email

I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.My $.02

"feminine-he , singular-they content - length : 8133 dear language scholars . i am presenting the following material as a discussion item . one of my ultimate purposes is to contribute to the revised oed due out in 2005 . for a paper i am currently working on , i ' m requesting comments and contributions . a summary will be forthcoming . feminine-he and singular-they mine is a new set of explanations for the two most regularly discussed grammatical oddities of english : indefinite / proverbial he and singular they . ( i will also touch on them and their . ) the orthodox view of pronoun history ( for she , they , them , their ) involves the north-to - south "" wave theory , "" as stated as early as 1866 by richard morris . it is the theory that is set forth in the oed and has never been questioned . the feminine h - stem , according to this accepted view , was displaced in the language in a wave of cultural diffusion when the feminine pronunciation began to approximate that of the masculine pronoun in the 12th and 13th centuries . the other pronouns discussed here also involved the north-to - south waves of diffusion . my contention is that the significant cause for the historical replacement of these pronouns ( except for the h - stem subject plural ) was the standardizing force exerted by the printing press - - it happened rather quickly - - not waves of cultural diffusion over centuries . in my analysis of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman , the h - stem feminine is found with great regularity . how can this be explained ? in many lines , the occurrences in the manuscripts of h - stem feminines outnumber the sh - forms found in the same lines . many manuscripts use both forms . the manuscripts are copies of copies of copies . on the bases of the manuscripts that have been dated , i place the "" average "" manuscript within a few generations of the advent of printing . my explanation , perhaps the anglo - norman rulers had a predilection for a distinction in the masculine / feminine singular . while the folk generally used the bi-gendric "" egalitatian "" h - stem form in the vernacular , the more politically correct sh - form was preferred at oxford / cambridge , in proper social etiquette , and in writing when referring to a "" lady . "" when caxton began his enterprise , the sh - form ( as well as the others spoken of here ) became enforced as the correct form through the great power of the press . and the h - stem feminine remained known in the spoken language , alongside the sh - form , well beyond printing . it had not dropped from speech and become archaic by 1300 . when the "" prescriptive "" grammarians prescribed indefinite-he , this h - stem still carried in its semantic domain a bi-gendric reference . although the seventeen manuscripts of piers is my main corpus of evidence , there are various kinds of other evidence to support my theory for the late survival of the h - stem feminine in the colloquial of the middle ages . one of the more interesting is the existence of the h - stem feminine in gullah ( when and if west african origins are discounted ) . other supporting evidence can be found in various places in the oed . it is scanty and scattered , but nonetheless there . h - stem and sh - form feminines existed for centuries , side by side , as formal and informal , although , for sure , in many cases the distinction was lost . "" hi was a fair wifman "" is found in the mid - 14th century agenbite of inwyt ( i am currently translating this work ) . in it , the pronunciation of the feminine pronoun is the same as the modern masculine ! ( the vowel had not yet diphthongized ) . the supposition that this h - stem is a "" literary form , "" as suggested by the oed ( presumably this means copied in manuscript from an earlier exemplar ) is untenable because the agenbite was translated directly from french . i have extracted the pronoun paradigms from all the manuscripts of the a - version of piers . in addition to the great evidence for the wide use of the h - stem feminine centuries beyond its supposed demise , the h - stem plural ( although extremely rare ) can also be found ( in line prologue 63 it is used to satisfy alliteration ! ) . and in every manuscript of piers the h - stem obliques ( modern them and their ) are to be found ( often alongside the th - forms ) . and then , in a generation after printing , the h - stems for she , they , them , and their seem to vanish ! ! , at least from the written evidence . the h - stem feminine held wide currency in the colloquial of the middle ages and therefore , supported by other evidence , was not unknown to the prescriptive grammarians a few centuries later . the accepted theory that the h - stem feminine dropped from the language before 1300 , prior to the time the poem "" alysoun "" was written , is in need of revision . piers shows it to have been very much alive in the 15th century . an explanation for the replacement of the h - stem plural nominative by they , a replacement occurring earlier than the other pronouns in question , has never been proposed . would n't there have been pressure for some alternative to the oe h - stem subject plural as a result of the disappearance of the preterit plural during this period ? because the english verb lost its marker in the preterit for number , the h - stem plural ( which shared the same form with the feminine singular nominative ) became in some contexts ambiguous for number . a new form was needed . although a norse form may have reinforced it among northern speakers , there was a native singular form available from the same set of oe demonstratives that gave us the . the and they appear to be duplets . if this is so , then the singular morphology of they is in fact historical and has been alive in the colloquial for a very long time ! ! the , in oe a singular , developed as a singular / plural ( the car / cars ) , extended to the accusative , but lost its absolute ( stand-alone ) use . they , retaining the pronunciation of oe the , was restricted to the nominative , and became the unambiguous written plural by 1400 - - but in the colloquial it retained also its singular morphology . later , in regard to them and their , caxton used the th - forms as the unambiguous plurals because the h - stems for these pronouns had throughout england a tremendous diversity of forms . for example , in one ( written ) dialect her would be a feminine / singular / possesive , in another it would be an all-genders / plural / possesive . caxton needed forms that would be universally understood , hence the written th - form obliques replaced the h - stems in an historic blink of the eye - - not in a wave of cultural diffusion that coincidentally wafted through london at the time caxton set up his print shop . a well supported case can be made for the late survival of the h - stem feminine , into the 15th century , and hence a case for its cultural currency at the time of the prescriptive grammarians . if this is so , the exclusion of one gender from "" cognitive space "" would not apply , and hence the motives of these grammarians would have to be reassessed . if in fact the sapir - whorf hypothesis does apply to pronouns , then i invite comment to help me understand two facts . 1 ) that for two-thirds of the history of english the subject pronoun used to refer to a group of men / boys was a form that was identical to the feminine singular ; and 2 ) the expression by a pronoun of "" possessing "" something by men / boys was also for two-thirds of the history of english expressed by a form that was morphologically marked for feminine but not masculine .",Safe Email

"foreign language culture conference organizer : faculty of foreign languages laboratory of communicative teaching through cultural interaction . kursk state pedagogical university . 33 radischev street , kursk 305004 , russia tel . ( 071 22 ) 2-73 - 61 fax . ( 0712 ) 568461 e-mail : kgpu @ home . sovtest . ru international conference : the voice of the foreign language culture tentatively scheduled for october 12-16 , 1998 at kursk state pedagogical university , russia . goal : defining general approaches taken by russian and foreign methodologists to the problem of communicative pronunciation teaching . foreign language pronunciation , vital for communication , is a complex phenomenon difficult to investigate and not readily yielding to teaching guidance . no wonder , occasionally it will be declared irrelevant and the attention of the methodologists and teachers is concentrated on more learnable items : grammar and vocabulary . indeed , either the intuitive - imitative approach with its attention to the accuracy of pronunciation or the analytic - linguistic approach with its articulatory and contrastive information , or the cognitive approach which gives emphases to grammar , or the natural approach and the silent way with the attention to the supra - segmental structures have not met the needs of communication . however , this kind of neglect of pronunciation teaching is of short duration and it could not be otherwise for evident reasons . it is pronunciation that reflects the national character , culture and spirit of the nation , the social characteristics of the speaker , their aims , motives and emotions . you would not really respond adequately to what is being said without the proper awareness of the implications of the pronunciation system . moreover , even in the recognition of grammar and lexical units we mainly depend on pronunciation parameters . in fact , all speech activities have pronunciation roots . that is why we can not neglect teaching pronunciation if we want to prepare our students for actual communication . in the communicative approach adhered to in this institution , we demand a communicative paradigm of pronunciation teaching . it implies both the communicative aim of teaching and structuring the teaching process in accordance with the natural mechanisms of pronunciation acquisition . there is evidence that communicative approach to teaching pronunciation is gaining universal support . according to m . celces - murcia , d . m . brinton , j . m . goodwin in "" teaching pronunciation , "" _ cup _ , 1996 . . . teaching supra-segmental features ( rhythm , stress and intonation in a discourse context was the optimal way to organize a short - term pronunciation course . this idea sounds promising for a more fundamental course if we take into account the psychological nature of pronunciation acquisition . the objectives of the conference are as follows : emphasize social importance and necessity of correct pronunciation point out general problems of teaching fl pronunciation develop a communicative syllabus for teaching fl pronunciation and specify the teaching units and the context of teaching definine communicative strategies for pronunciation teaching specify the communicative model for teaching pronunciation and its correlation with natural speech mechanisms define the links of fl culture and pronunciation teaching analyze the communicative model of pronunciation teaching as a component of teacher education outline the linguistic foundation of communicative fl pronunciation teaching identify the links between pronunciation and grammar , vocabulary and pragmatic context . discussion groups on suggested topics : 1 . the social load and the status of pronunciation in multi-cultural society . 2 . pronunciation as an indicator of language proficiency and cultural level . 3 . communicative teaching of pronunciation as a basis for teaching fl speech . 4 . functional and linguistic aspects of pronunciation teaching . 5 . techniques of communicative teaching of fl pronunciation . we would be delighted to discuss the problems and share our experience with those of similar interests . we sincerely hope that the integral efforts of the participants of the conference will result in solving some of the problems and enrich our practical competence . first call for papers . the faculty of foreign languages and the laboratory of communicative fl teaching through cultural interaction at kursk state pedagogical university ( russia ) cordially invite colleagues from asia , africa , america and europe to participate in their international conference . we desire to share achievements , concerns and exchange expertise in teaching english , german and french phonetics and pronunciation . all teachers and methodologists are welcome to attend . papers of 2000 words will be published subsequently in the conference proceedings . final date for acceptance of applications and papers to the above address by 1 july 1998 . kursk , a city lacated 450 km to the south of moscow , is one of the oldest cities in russia with a number of attractions interesting from historical and cultural points of view . accomodation will be provided at the hotel kursk ( 40-60 $ per night ) . participants will also be offered to live in the appartments with russian families and the students ' dormitory . foreign particapants will be met in moscow and accompanied to kursk if required . we look forward to hearing from you . sincerely , nickolay smakhtin dean of the faculty of foreign languages vyacheslav buzhinsky head of the english language department",Safe Email

coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week , establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel . the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal / synfuel spread . the coal cash book , which began trading only two months ago , has traded over 2 million spot tons . the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies , while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal . enron energy and operational services - ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections . because of the culture shock associated the use of the words ' enron ' and ' coal ' in the same sentence , consideration was been given to changing the name to dng ( dense natural gas ) ; however , we went with solid fuel initiative . this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit . the primary areas are texas , florida , southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area . there are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued : brownsville , tx and brighton fl . in brownsville , the team secured formal owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the brownsville ship channel . this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay . a 500 mw facility is being considered for brownsville . as conceptualized , it will consist of two - 250 mw ( net ) cfb units ( circulating fluidized bed ) boilers . the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke ( petcoke ) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible . one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity . there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity . as stated the plant is initially 500 mw , but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 mw facility . the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin & cheryl kent , project admin assistants , bill fox as pem , and paula solomon as pcm . as the project develops there will be more team members required . in addition , as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team . esource esource , enron ' s research group , recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies . these reports are free and available to all enron employees on the esource hot topics page at http : / / esource . enron . com / hot _ topics . asp . to date , over 1 , 600 employees have downloaded "" spending wisely on private hubs "" , a report valued at $ 2 , 000 . over 1 , 100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports , provided by investext . the reports , which are updated continuously , are presented in folders by company and industry . new folders are being added upon request . to submit a suggestion for a new folder , please complete the suggestion form at http : / / esource . enron . com / suggestion . asp . watch for the new esource bulletin , the source . it will feature frequently requested searches , tips on finding information , new products , services , and events . meanwhile , to further fulfill enron ' s information needs , esource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to enron employees . enron freight markets efm signed a firm contract with streamline shippers association last week to provide truckload capacity for one - year with efm ' s option to extend the contract for up to an additional year . streamline transloads international shipments that enter the u . s . through the ports of long beach and los angeles . streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country . efm will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week . in the news we are pleased to announce that sally beck has been named chief operating officer for enron net works . she will join greg piper , president and chief executive officer and mark pickering , chief technology officer in the enron net works office of the chair . in her current role as managing director for enron net works , sally heads up enron ' s global risk management operations . she brings more than 20 years professional experience to enron , joining the company in 1992 . she graduated from the university of texas at austin with a b . b . a . in marketing and an mba with a concentration in finance . welcome new hires egm -

using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
packages.Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd
approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install "", but removing
all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.Matthias--

"Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla 
1.1?
 (Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I 
presume?)Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't 
find vCard or a reference to it anywhere.  I like the Netscape/Mozilla 
email client.  I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only 
(my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are 
becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
the two?I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along 
with more PKI oriented focus.  Any wisdom would be appreciated.  In

Unless each key on my keyboard were

idea that, if one wishes to do multiple

our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE

programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.-Dave(Oracle, in their quest for portability,
used to use raw disks for the database.
This finessed the filesystem issue; did
it also allow them to roll their own set

for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would 
prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1% 
of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't 
be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair 
amount of fake users too.Now, for the ""fair amount of fake users"", spammers don't have access to 
many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming 
from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class 
C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is 
going on. This could also trigger alarms.As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any
thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may 
be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from 
the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger 
for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL 
could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone 
line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class 
C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have 
several connections at different locations, but that increases their 
cost and so is not so much interesting.	Jehan-------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking for the disks for SUSE 8. Does anybody
have them for a reasonable price?
I'm available to collect at the time of your
convenience anywhere in the East/Greater
Dublin area!
TIA.
Paul...

spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set
to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score
* relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large
corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of
*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing
only tests that are expensive for their utility.Unfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.--

( we do n't seem to ever have had it in past tense ) . 2 . in colloquial speech , the same is happening to 2nd person , no doubt because the 2nd and 3rd person plural fem forms are identical ( though not the masc ones they have converged with ) . 3 . this needs to be checked ! the free plural feminine pronoun , as well as past inflections of same seem to me to be shaking . but real data has to be recorded for this , so do n't make much of this . i wonder whether mixed forms are possible , namely , you-fem go + masc , etc . * and on a more theoretical note * : hopefully you will find very few examples for what you are looking , because i believe ( what others have been saying for about a hundred years ) that inflections tend to develop out of free pronouns . hence , the dependence between the meanings encoded , though there is no principled reason for the inflection to change later , i guess . it is really unlikely , though , because once the form is inflected , fused with the verb , chances are it won't develop its separate semantics . if you ' re interested in theories about the development of inflection out of pronouns , i have my own , which accounts for the well-known fact that inflections for 1st and 2nd person are much more prevalent than 3rd person . i claim this is so not because 3rd person is unmarked , but rather , since referents of 3rd person are usually much less accessible than referents of 1st and 2nd person ( the speaker and the addressee ) . minimal forms are reserved for more accessible referents ( in general ) , hence inflections are the natural development out of free pronouns for highly accessible antecedents . you can have a look at my book ' accessing np antecedents ' , routledge , 1990 , chapter 6 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the following two respondents quote cases where logophoric and obviative marking occur attached to the verb rather than to the pronoun to which they refer . to me , it seems that these particles are not inflections as such , though i am not sure exactly how i would classify them . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - june wickboldt : jwickbol @ ucs . indiana . edu some languages having logophoric reference mark the reference with verbal affixes , not pronouns or pronominals . two are newari , see karen ebert . 1986 . reported speech in some languages of nepal . in f . coulmas ( ed . ) direct and indirect speech , berlin : mouton de gruyter , and gokana , see hyman , larry m . and bernard comrie . 1981 . logophoric reference in gokana . journal of african languages and linguistics . 3 : 19-37 . brian d joseph ( bjoseph @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu ) the algonquian language cree , spoken in canada , has a category known in the literature as "" obviative "" , which provides a way of distinguishing between different third-persons in a discourse ( the first one mentioned is "" proximate "" , and the next one mentioned is "" obviative "" , so cree can distinguish unambiguously between "" john met bill as he was walking down the street "" where rhe "" in english can refer to either john or bill - - in cree it would be unambiguously one or the other ) . for the most part , and this is where it is relevant to you , this marking shows up on the verb ( thus the verb form in the above sentence would be different if it was john walking or bill walking ) ; nouns can show obviative / proximate marking ( though one class , the so-called "" inanimate "" nouns do not ) , and there are proximate and obviative forms of demonstrative pronouns , but not of the personal pronouns . thus "" wi : ya "" is ' he / proximate ' as well as ' he / obviative ' . pronouns are not usually expressed in cree , but if you just look at the personal pronouns , then cree would be a language of the sort you were looking for . for that matter , these facts are similar in virtually all the algonquian languages , so it is n't just cree . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - finally , two respondents noted that independent pronouns are not necessarily marked for case in the same way as pronominal affixes . such phenomena do not seem rare to me ( e . g . arabic does the same ) . i am assuming then that such cases are not marked . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "" ellen l . contini - morava "" ( elc9j @ faraday . clas . virginia . edu ) in swahili part of the verb morphology is subject and object prefixes , that signal info . about participant role with respect to the action of the verb . this distinction is not made among independent pronouns , which distinguish only person and number . but since the subject and object prefixes in swahili are often called "" pronominal "" , i do n't know if this counts as a distinction that can't be made by pronouns . simon corston ( corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu ) in my ma , in press in the pacific linguistics series from anu , i discuss ' ergativity in roviana ' . roviana has special pronominal forms used for absolutive ( s ( 's ubject of intr ' ) or o ( ' object ' ) ) , and different forms for a ( 's ubject of tr ' ) . the pronouns make distinctions in person , number , and incl / ecl for 1pl . there are pronominal verbal affixes on the verb which are always only o . i . e . whereas the independent prons do n't distinguish s / o , the pronominal affixes do . somewhere around here i have a brief sketch of roviana which i have been sending to people . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i found everything very interesting , and am happy to receive any more info on my query above . thanks again to those who responded ! maik gibson university of reading",Safe Email

"" company - specific problems ? dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said : "" some of the best deals are the ones that don ' t get done . "" "" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business , "" he said . dynegy president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom said that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for enron ' s diminished role in the business and that the industry has suffered "" no degradation , "" as he put it . "" there has been a clear flight to quality , and it ' s occurring as we speak , "" bergstrom said . "" dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform . "" dynegydirect is a platform much like enron ' s flagship enrononline , which it turned off wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online energy - trading platform , accounting for an average of $ 3 billion in trades a day . dynegy ' s trading exposure to enron is $ 75 million , and the company is no longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow houston industrial giant , bergstrom said . "" dynegy ' s customer - based , asset - backed energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us with earnings sustainability and future growth . "" watson said . as part of the deal , dynegy had the option to keep northern natural gas , enron ' s highly valued natural - gas pipeline , even if the agreement were terminated . the company said during the call that it would exercise that option . chevrontexaco ( cvx ) , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , originally gave $ 1 . 5 billion to the company in the transaction . dynegy used the money to purchase 100 percent of the preferred shares of northern natural gas . enron has 180 days from the date the merger agreement was signed , nov . 9 , to repurchase the pipeline system , watson said . enron said in a statement that it was reviewing dynegy ' s claim of rights to northern . enron representatives did not participate in the call , and dynegy executives said they had been advised against the customary practice of taking questions . enron said it has temporarily suspended payments "" other than those necessary to maintain "" its core energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those operations alive . "" to do this , we will work to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses , "" said enron chairman and ceo ken lay . enron told employees their questions would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks on friday . analysts said the next step for enron would likely be a bankruptcy filing . "" chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means , "" said john olson , a houston - based energy analyst . "" the key to salvaging the business is the level of debtor - in - possession financing they can get to allow them to trade in some realistic fashion . "" dip financing takes precedence over all other claims , he said . "" the equity people are now at the very bottom of the barrel , and the only people lower than them are [ the people who filed ] the stockholder suits , "" olson said . in a note to clients , analyst michael heim of a . g . edwards said that enron , without dynegy , has "" no value . "" "" enron . . . will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim said . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" ahead of this news , s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" moody ' s made its announcement of a rating cut to b 2 from baa 3 and said that enron ' s debt remains under review for additional downgrade . in its report , moody ' s cited the likelihood of a dynegy - enron breakup , fueled by enron ' s declining financial performance , as the reason for the downgrade . "" moody ' s . . . baa 3 rating was predicated on good prospects for completion of the merger with dynegy and reasonable prospects for marginally investment - grade characteristics of the merged entity , "" moody ' s wrote . "" furthermore , lack of confidence in enron by its trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting enron ' s core trading operations . "" for enron to survive , the credit agency said , it ' s imperative that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable . fitch , which had rated enron bbb - minus , lowered the rating to cc , which "" indicates that default of some kind appears probable . "" the u . s . treasury is keeping an eye on the impact the enron fallout is having on the credit markets , spokeswoman michele davis said wednesday .

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: ""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" ""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political boundaries."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.ï¿½ï¿½ The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.ï¿½ï¿½ The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.ï¿½ï¿½ Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.ï¿½ï¿½ Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.ï¿½ï¿½ The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.ï¿½ï¿½ It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.ï¿½ï¿½ While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.ï¿½ï¿½ The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.ï¿½ï¿½ Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.ï¿½ï¿½ The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.ï¿½ï¿½ The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.ï¿½ï¿½ Your understanding is appreciated.ï¿½ï¿½ SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE December 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: Communiquï¿½ï¿½ to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'ï¿½ï¿½tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE May 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. SKIP TO NEXT FILE ï¿½TOP OF PAGE March 31, 1997: News Release An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGE November 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone Robert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission DO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands http://www.enenkio.org",Phishing Email

  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network  ###  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""  About Magi
  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms

Date: Not suppliedEli the Bearded sez:     Ever wanted to see an international agreement? There are an awful lot of 
    them here, and the ones I looked at were surprizingly readable. I was 
    looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of 
    Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The 
    Oslo Accords (Israel/PLO agreement of 1993) is another thing much shorter

theoretic approaches will be favoured over those approaches based on analogy with human cognitive processes , though mathematical discussions of such processes will be appropriate . the basic questions to be addressed include o classification of objects in a taxonomy : systemic classification , semantic indexing , partial-order sorting , description identification , and taxonomy maintenance . o efficient order , lattice , graph , and code theoretic operations on objects : subsumption , generalization , specialization , least common generalization , and greatest common specialization . o advanced uses of taxonomies : knowledge compression , knowledge compilation , and knowledge evolution . o using classified knowledge : classification as problem solving , classification as constraint satisfaction , and exploiting abstraction . o scalable techniques for large object databases o integration of data and knowledge base technologies the symposium will maintain a balance between theoretical issues and descriptions of implemented systems providing a balance between theory and practice . the focus of the symposium is on efficiency of retrieval , use and storage . authors ' information papers may not exceed 15 pages . shorter , substantive papers are welcome . authors are requested to submit five ( 5 ) copies of their paper . alternatively , electronic submissions ( by ftp or email ) of papers ( postscript output ) are encouraged . submission by ftp : please place in ftp . cs . rmit . edu . au incoming directory . authors are further requested to attach title pages to their submissions bearing their names , addresses , telephone numbers , fax numbers and e-mail addresses . in addition , authors are asked to include abstracts of approximately twenty ( 20 ) lines with each paper , and a list of short phrases descriptive of the content . papers must be postmarked on or before monday february 13 , 1995 . address : kruse c / o gerard ellis computer science dept . rmit gpo box 2476v , melbourne , vic 3001 australia email : ged @ cs . rmit . edu . au ph : 61 -

"China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Bank, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, ""How can I 
participate in this explosion?"" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITYTexas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.Opening China's DoorUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. *** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico. To SUBSCRIBE to the future communications, please click on this link and hit send:

( lantolf 's 75 - item list of references includes works by vera john - steiner , alexei leontiev , david olson , lev vygotsky , and other important authors usually neglected in l2 research . ) although few readers will find all of the papers of interest , every paper makes a contribution to our understanding of its topic , and taken together these volumes contain something worth the close attention of every conceivable reader in linguistics , developmental and experimental psycholinguistics , and second language theory and pedagogy . given the longstanding facts of 1 ) the prominence of spanish as a national language in the new world , 2 ) the preeminence of spanish as the first language of bilinguals in the us , and 3 ) the ubiquity ( and , more recently , the predominance ) of spanish and english as the languages studied in schools and colleges throughout the americas , spanish language acquisition and spanish - english child and adult bilingualism ought to be among the most common and well-supported areas of basic and applied psycholinguistic research . without going into the cultural , economic , and political factors that have held back such research , and that have pushed the study of spanish - english bilingualism almost entirely into the politically charged domain of ( mostly spanish - subtractive ) "" bilingual education "" , we can be grateful to p&g for bringing together an impressive array of high-quality studies that should stimulate many to pay more attention to these widely available sources of data on critical issues in l1 and l2 acquisition theory and in the psycholinguistics ( as opposed to the sociolinguistics ) of bilingualism . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ h stephen straight ( phd chicago 1972 ) , professor of anthropology and of linguistics , directs the programs in linguistics and in languages across the curriculum at binghamton university ( suny ) , where he has taught since 1970 . his research includes study of yucatec maya l1 acquisition , comparative sociolinguistics , translation theory , l2 pedagogy , multilingual education , and the role of the reception-expression dialectic in models of language and cognitive processes .",Safe Email

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.

"special issue cl journal / finite state methods . . . please post or distribute call for papers computational linguistics special issue on finite state methods in natural language processing recent years has seen a substantial increase in the use of finite state techniques in many aspects of natural language processing as mature tools for building large scale finite-state systems from various research laboratories and universities become available . this trend was by no means foreseen as late as ten years ago given the well-known demonstration by noam chomsky in 1957 that finite-state methods are inherently incapable of representing the full richness of constructions in a natural language . nevertheless , it is evident now that there are many subsets of natural language that are adequately covered by finite-state means and that there are many other areas where finite-state approximations of more powerful formalisms are of great practical benefit . as a follow-up to the fsmnlp ' 98 , international workshop on finite state methods in natural language processing , it was proposed that a collection of papers in this area be published as a special issue of the computational linguistics journal . we would to encourage authors of the papers presented at this workshop , as well as all others who would like to contribute , to submit full versions of their papers for consideration for this special issue . guest editors : lauri karttunen ( xerox research centre europe , france ) kemal oflazer ( bilkent university , turkey ) guest editorial board eric brill ( johns hopkins university , md , usa ) eva ejerhed ( umea university , sweden ) ronald m . kaplan ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) martin kay ( xerox palo alto research center , ca , usa ) george kiraz ( bell laboratories , nj , usa ) andrs kornai ( bbn , ma , usa ) mehryar mohri ( at&t labs research , nj , usa ) mark - jan nederhof ( dfki , germany ) atro voutilainen ( university of helsinki , finland ) submission details please submit 6 copies of your hard-copy manuscript to lauri karttunen xerox research centre europe 6 chemin de maupertuis meylan , 38240 , france by monday , october 19 , 1998 . the format of the submission should follow the general submission requirements of the journal . manuscripts for computational linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper ( 8 . 5 by 11 inches , or a4 ) , double-spaced throughout , including footnotes and references . the paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words . manuscripts must be written in english .",Safe Email

"two seperate projects this weekend.  first mod_gzip which is an apache
module to speed up serving static and dynamic mime(text/.*) web content.
the second is the compaq smart array configs for linux.before i go on much more i'll cover the following bits: the server
is running redhat 7.3 linux with all the updates on a compaq dl380.
the client is running the same on a compaq laptop.  pretty much everything
is stock redhat 7.3 - and i'm consciously trying to stick to that.------------------------------------------------------------------------
mod_gzip:
    
    there's a tutorial on linux.ie for it (thanks donnacha) but since i'm
    not an apache person this only got me part of the way.  step by step,
    this is what i did:	# cd /root
	# wget http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/src/1.3.19.1a/mod_gzip.c.gz
	# gunzip mod_gzip.c.gz
	# apxs -ic mod_gzip.c
    
    that should compile and install fine, so add the following to
    your apache configs.  i've included comments to explain where they
    should go.  my apache config is split among many files (which is
    why i didn't use the -a flag to apxs).	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	LoadModule gzip_module        /usr/lib/apache/mod_gzip.so
	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	AddModule mod_gzip.c
	# this just needs to go below the obove two lines.

compaq smart array config:   (WARNING: YOU NEED A JVM FOR YOUR BROWSER)    i searched on google for ""compaq smart array configuration linux"" and
    got a slew of hits.  one of them was a click away from this page:	http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/us/download/14703.html    i downloaded the rpm.  installed it. and ran the server per the
    instructions.  note, the -R enables remote connections.  if you're
    running the browser locally, run it without the -R and connect
    to localhost.	cpqacuxe -R    i found that galeon didn't work.  mozilla did.  i suspect it's because
    pop-ups are disabled in galeon config, but i might be wrong.  it uses
    java which is slow and memory hungry on this laptop.  feel free to
    try galeon with pop-ups enabled if you want to.    so, point mozilla at http://yourserver:2301/ .  login as
    administrator/administrator and change your password.  then go back
    to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards
    the bottom.  configure your array as you want (i had to add a disk).
    save your changes, and exit.  to stop the server, just do this:	cpqacuxe -stop    in my case the drive was now accessible.  i started the process of
    making the file systems by partitioning the drive.  i knew what
    it would be called, but a grep for ida on the output of dmesg
    confirmed it.	fdisk /dev/ida/c0d1    and from there i built the filesystems and so on.hope this helps some folks,kevin--

co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.R. Kevin Oberman, Network Engineer

"re : 3 . 421 linguists , human subjects i had the same reaction as martin volk to michael kac 's idea that linguists become linguists because they ' re superior language learners . my gut reaction was that it must be wrong , that we become linguists because we have a hard time learning language , that effortless polyglots pay no conscious attention at all to grammar or any other systems of rules . i was about to offer myself as an example when i realized that i _ am _ a pretty good language learner , but i ' ve always found the process frustrating . i hated learning languages because it seemed so dreary and inefficient until i discovered some shortcuts , namely syntax , phonology , morphology , etc . if my case is at all generalizable , then ( happily ) messrs volk and kac are both right - - we become linguists because we have some skill at language learning , but we are also the rational sort that thinks there must be a better , more efficient way to go about it ( and therefore perceive ourselves as having "" trouble "" with it ) . am i weird , or did it happen this way for other people ? let 's hear more . mark hansell asian lang . & lit . carleton college northfield , mn usa",Safe Email
"the ldc united nations corpus in linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175",Safe Email

"your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ?

"ngi article on tw ruling ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 29 , 2001 alj clears transwestern of market power charges a ferc administrative law judge has found no improprieties , nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between transwestern pipeline and two shippers on its system , which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $ 27 / mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline ' s allowed transportation rate of 38 cents / mmbtu ( rp 97 - 288 - 009 ) . alj jacob leventhal had only one fault to find , and that was with transwestern ' s method of posting capacity . the judge said , and transwestern agreed , to modify its tariff "" so that all posting , bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption "" on its internet bulletin board . shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the transwestern web site was "" a tortuous process . "" indicated shippers claimed transwestern ' s inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available . while "" both indicated shippers and ( ferc ) staff find it curious that set ( sempra energy trading ) and richardson ( products co . ) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them . . . curiosity does not translate into proof , "" the judge said . witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting . the judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with transwestern ' s tariff . similarly , levanthal could find no evidence that transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity . the capacity was available at recourse rates , and the shippers knew those rates were available . "" staff ' s arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures , but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power . "" the two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "" index - to - index "" formula that produced the higher rates , rather than take the recourse rate "" to minimize any risk on transportation options . "" the index - to - index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them . in this case the two points were the san juan basin and the socal needles delivery point . the case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations .",Safe Email

"policies moderators ' message a very happy 1995 to all our subscribers ! as you can see , linguist is back on line - - on the 8th , not the 5th as we had hoped , but we are now up and running at our new address . remember : those of you who post to linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu can continue to use that address . but those of you who used to post to linguist @ tamsun . tamu . edu must change either to the . . . tamvm1 address or to linguist @ tam2000 . tamu . edu the latter is our new editorial address . the . . . tamsun address is now worse than useless : the machine itself has been taken off line by texas a&m , so any messages sent there will simply disappear into an internet black hole . they will not be forwarded to us . the new year 's issues start with this issue : 6 . 1 . however , the listserv swallowed some of the issues we posted on dec . 20 and is just now sending them out . so you probably received some issues of volume 5 ( 1994 ) only today . this is not what we intended - - indeed , we worked hard to clear the mailer and post all the messages we had received before we shut down on dec 21 . we realize that some of them had deadlines . however , listserv malfunctions are simply not within our control . the texas a&m sysop took a long ( well-deserved ) ( and , we hope , energizing ) christmas vacation . and , until his return , the listserv would not free the issues we had posted . and that , by a lightening transition , brings us to a few remarks on maintaining free discussion on linguist . as linguist grows , it becomes potentially more powerful - - some might say "" threatening "" - - by virtue of its role as an information source . it 's natural that controversial policies and postings should generate concern ; and last year we received a number of complaints , protests , and editorial suggestions . we tried to respond to every message individually ; but we 'd also like to publicly explain our policies and our current thinking about some of the issues that arose . if any of you care to respond , we can continue this discusson on linguist . * we received several requests that we check the accuracy of controversial claims and allegations before we post them . however reasonable this sounds , unfortunately it simply is n't possible . linguist processes 50-70 messages a day ; last year we assembled and posted 1600 issues ( as those of you with overfull mailboxes know ! ) ; and we get over 1000 database requests a week , about 1 / 4 of which require some kind of administrative interchange . we ask our 3 student editors to check messages for civility ( more on this below ) ; but they do n't have time to check anything which is not immediately before them on the screen . so there is no way that we can strive for the standards of accuracy of paper journals . and , of course , we aren ' t a journal ; we ' re a discussion list . the only effective check on the accuracy of any posting is the discussion itself . so the moral is : - - read with a little scepticism - - and , if you see an inaccuracy , post a correction * the preceding applies , of course , to _ professional _ content in postings ; we can't be responsible for the accuracy of anyone 's claims about the number of words for "" snow . "" nor - - and this is the problematic area - - can we check claims about anyone 's or any institution 's decisions , opinions , or conduct . we will make every effort to ensure that any such posting has professional relevance , is temperate in phrasing , and ( if at all possible ) does not mention names . we also try not to publicize controversies having only personal relevance , since we do n't want linguist to become simply a forum for private grievances . but more than that we can't do . * about more widespread grievances : we have gotten many protests about cutting off discussions that criticize specific schools of linguistics . our problem with some of these has been that the criticisms were anecdotal , ( sometimes ) devoid of academic content , and sounded personally aggrieved ( see above ) . also , adherents of the schools under attack were telling us they no longer felt welcome on the list . so - - not wanting linguist to become a grievance forum or a cause of unnecessary divisiveness in the discipline - - we cut off the discussions . but we admit that there are good arguments on the side of free speech . so we have decided at least not to cut off discussions abruptly . instead , we will warn "" next - to-last posting on x "" before we send out a "" last posting "" message . and we will post any responses on x received in the interim . also , we 'd like to reiterate that any discussion that could compare schools or theories and stick to the academic issues would be very welcome . we are not committed to protecting any school from _ scholarly _ criticism ; and , in fact , we would tell any protestors that this is a discussion list , and if they feel attacked they must defend themselves through discussion . * about civility : we never intended to become a kind of electronic miss manners , and , frankly , it often feels like a very strange role for your uncouth moderators . however , we ' re committed to keeping postings civil in tone because ( 1 ) more than one academic list has ( literally ) gone down in flames - - i . e . , the list has disbanded because the discussions got too personal and heated ; and ( 2 ) , as much as possible , we 'd like everyone - - not just the brave or foolhardy - - to feel comfortable entering a linguist discussion . so we do occasionally return postings with a request that the writer revise toward a less-inflammatory tone .

"summary of last 6 months projects dear dale , stinson & vince , i would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to summarise the projects of the past six months . firstly , by all accounts it has been an amazing few months for me - i believe that i have kept a large number of commercial group heads very happy . however , not all are aware of my activities , so , many people ( e . g . john sherriff , richard lewis , steve young etc . ) will not know of everything i have done . for example the amount of work that i put into the inflation models and the extent to which i was critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent impact ( o 7 + million for ql ) and similar large p & l swings for eastern contract optionality ( short virtual power station ) based upon my uk power vol curve generator . for your benefit , i have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on over the past five / six months : 1 ) inflation curve modelling ( february and march + april internal audit + june external audit ) 2 ) uk power monthly vol curve generator & ideas for half - hourly vol curve 3 ) nordic power monthly vol curve generator 4 ) energydesk . com models & support 5 ) real options : options to build / extend power stations ( e . g . wessex deal , anti - freeze project ) 6 ) continental power non - generic options ( using arbitrary trader - specified distributions ) 7 ) global products : non - generic options modelling and new commodity forward curve construction ( benzene fwd curve from naphtha ) 8 ) exotic options library upgrade / model test / bug fixes ( e . g . testing new / old asian models ) 9 ) continental gas volatility curve construction 10 ) communication objective i : two presentations to enron europe staff , one to oslo office 11 ) communication objective ii : meetings to gather information and present results 12 ) fas 133 : working with internal and external auditors on matching financial and physical ( accrual ) hedges - hedge effectiveness 13 ) oslo trip : bringing oslo up to speed on exotica and option valuation 14 ) houston research staff : co - ordinating communication / meetings to maximise productivity 15 ) valuation / marketing of power put options for banks that hold senior and sub debt in merchant power plant meeting breakdown : initiated by me it is clear that i have been critical to large p & l sensitive projects and hope that i can continue to help enhance earnings going forward . regards , anjam x 35383",Safe Email

"Hi,This might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)I'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,
called UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).I'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the
KOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in
which I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to
Ireland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.So, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any
other free software.Thank you very much for your helpThomasThomas Petazzoni

"Hello all
I'm looking for advice. My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying
to access IP 62.17.143.253 without my consent. It has got to the stage where
normal web-browsing is almost impossible.
I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being
called. I contacted that company on 14 July, when the problem first arose
and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply.
A helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal. I
ran this and haven't had a problem again until today.
The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db. (I run adaware with
current ref files every day now).
Any suggestions, please,  for removing whatever the f*** is causing this
from my pc?
Brian

The new spec didn't even want to build the package
something with config.mak
Also this new spec looks like the old one, it got libdv and libdv-devel
in the BuildRequires so I just used the normal spec and removed it manully.Roi

"ellipsis in conjunction call for papers , focus group , zas , berlin , oct . 2 - 3 , 1998 workshop on ellipsis in conjunction in view of the growing interest in conjunction ellipsis this workshop is an attempt to promote the communication and bridge the gaps between different approaches within the framework of generative syntax . the workshop will concentrate on the following issues : ( 1 ) the structure of a conjunction construction . is the base-generated structure of a coordinate construction a double-headed structure ( williams 1994 ) , or does it have the second conjunct right-adjoined to the first conjunct ( reinhart 1991 ) , or is it a projection of a conjunction word ( &p ) ( munn1987 ) , or something else ? ( 2 ) the possible categories to be conjoined . must a conjunct be a clause or an extended projection ( excluding smaller xp - types ) ? must a conjunct be an xp ( excluding head and x ' ) ? and how are ' asymmetrical coordinations ' analyzed if only ' like ' categories can be conjoined ? ( 3 ) the analyses of ellipsis and gapping constructions . the verb gapping construction , for instance , has been analyzed as rightward np movement followed by an identical constituent deletion ( jayaseelan 1990 ) , across - the - board verb movement ( johnson 1996 ) , and deletion licensed in lf ( wilder 1997 ) . in addition , it remains to be shown how to account for the relationships between vp ellipsis , pseudogapping and gapping . furthermore , a general study of sluicing is required to cover wh in-situ languages where slucing does not alternate with an overt movement to eliminate strong features of a wh question ( lasnik 1997 ) . ( 4 ) the analysis of similarities and differences among various types of reduction . how and why do coordinative , comparative , and exception conjunction ellipses share properties and differ from each other syntactically , and / or semantically ? are the properties of forwad deletion and backward deletion related to lf and pf respectively , as claimed by wilder ( 1997 ) ? ( 5 ) the constraints on the ellipsis constructions . what are the language-specific properties that might interact with the representations of conjunction ellipsis ? are there any ellipsis or gapping rules in ug ? ( 6 ) the connection between conjunction ellipsis and information structure . to what extent are such ellipses determined by information structural aspects like focus background structuring ? ( 7 ) studies of conjunction ellipsis of a greater variety of languages . invited speakers : danny fox tilman hoehle kyle johnson jason merchant alan munn craig thiersch chris wilder organizers : kerstin schwabe , niina zhang , horst - dieter gasde , and andre meinunger the deadline for receipt of abstracts is july 1 , 1998 . please send your abstract ( 1 a4 / letter - size max ) to : dr . niina zhang zas jaegerstr . 10-11 10117 berlin germany tel : 49-30 - 20192572 fax : 49-30 - 20192402 email : ellipsis @ zas . gwz-berlin . de we accept abstracts by fax , email , as well as regular mail . the selection of the abstracts for presentation will be finished by the end of august . zentrum fur allgemeine sprachwissenschaft ( zas ) http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de",Safe Email

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youï¿½ll know if itï¿½s right for you.  There is no cost

"petrochem desk i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group . from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research . nelson",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedRob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_

good alternative. You avoid false positive, only one email to list all

"comparative method ( shared sound changes ) alice faber 's very sound posting brings up a very important point : indvidual sound changes , especially those which are known to be common in languages of the world , cannot be the basis of subclassification . what you need is either sets of unrelated changes ( english has diphthongized some of the same long high vowels as high german , so that eis and ice , haus and house sound rather similar , but they do not share other changes ) , or a chronology of the sound changes with respect to other changes ( e . g . , the diphthongization in english was presumably preceded by the loss of / x / or / c , / , but there is no such change in high german ) . on the other hand , we find that the northern uto - aztecan languages share the changes of intervocalic / l / - ) / n / , / n / - > velar nasal , and / c / - > / y / . any one of these would mean little , but all three together ( and the fact that the / l / - ) / n / does not feed the / n / - > / ng / change ) make it reasonably certain that these really are shared innovations , and that northern uto - aztecan is a genuine classificatory unit ( a valid node in the uto - aztecan tree , if you will ) - - something that has until recently been generally doubted .",Safe Email
